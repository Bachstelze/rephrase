  republican  opposition to  obama &apos;s  re @-@ election  strategy  
republican  leaders have  justified  their  policy of  the need to  combat  electoral  fraud .  
however , the  brennan  center  believes  this myth  , saying that  electoral fraud  is  rare  in the united states  than the number of  people  killed  by lightning  .  
indeed ,  republican  lawyers  identified  only  300  cases of  election fraud  in the united states  for ten years  .  
one thing is certain  :  these new  provisions that  would have a negative effect  on voters  turn .  
in this sense ,  the measures  will be  partly  undermine  the american  democratic system  .  
unlike  canada ,  us states  are responsible for the  organization  of federal  elections in  the united states .  
it is in this  spirit  that most of  us government  passed  new laws  ,  since 2009  register  or the  electoral process  more difficult  .  
this phenomenon  has gained  momentum  after the elections  in november 2010  , which  saw  675  new  members of  the republican  added  in 26  states .  
as a result ,  180  bills  limiting  the exercise of  the right  to vote in  41  states  were introduced  in 2011  alone .  
the new  election laws  require  voters  to show  a photo  id  and proof of  us citizenship  .  
in addition , these  laws also  reduce the  early voting  periods  to refute  the right  to register  as  voters  on election day  and  withdraw  the right to vote  of citizens  with  criminal records  .  
on the eve of  the 2006 elections  ,  no us  state  requires  voters  to show  a photo  id  .  
indiana  became the  first state  to impose  such a requirement .  
in 2008 ,  the u.s. supreme court  upheld the  constitutionality of the  indiana  law .  
the republican authorities  were  quick  to spread  the practice  to other  states .  
over the last two years  , they  have organized  bills  in 34  states  get voters  to show  a photo  id  .  
it is important  to note that  , unlike in  quebec ,  american citizens  do not have  universal  id card  , such as  health insurance  card  .  
indeed ,  11 %  of american  citizens ,  i.e. the  21 million  people  of voting  age ,  do not have  a photo  id card  issued by the  authority of  their  state .  
in addition  , five  million new  voters in  2012 ,  do not have  such  identification .  
and  it often  costs  more than a hundred  dollars  to get  the necessary  id cards  .  
the new  restrictions are  disproportionately  affect  young people  ,  minorities and  people with  low incomes  .  
in fact  , 25  % african american ,  15  % of  those earning  less than $  35,000  ;  18 %  of citizens  over 65  years old  and 20  %  of voters  18 to  29  years old  , do not have  the required  photo  id cards  .  
and  that &apos;s not all  .  
the students  , voters  considered  ballot  more to  democratic  candidates ,  are not allowed  in several states  to use  a photo  id card  issued  their  institutions .  
on the other hand ,  these same  states  allow  fishing or  hunting  club members who  voted  more  republicans  to use the cards  issued by  these  clubs  when they  vote  .  
until 2004 ,  no state  requires  proof of  citizenship for  voting .  
arizona  was the first  to introduce  such a requirement .  
starting in  2011  ,  a dozen  states  have passed  laws  requiring  voters  to prove that  they are  u.s.  citizens .  
these measures  are clearly  intended to limit the  hispanic  voters .  
however ,  it seems that  two out of three  hispanic  voters  voted  democratic party .  
moreover , in  2011 ,  republican  legislators passed  laws  to cancel  the registration of voters  on election day  in eight  states .  
in addition , they  limited  the rights of  individuals and  groups ,  to provide assistance  to voters  wishing to  register .  
these  restrictions are  not without  consequences .  
for example ,  in the  2004  general election ,  voter registration  campaigns  contributed to  the registration of  about 10  million  citizens .  
however  , the  measures taken  since 2009  led to  17 %  decline  rate  registering  new voters  in 2010 ,  compared with  2006 .  
in addition ,  republican  lawmakers  have enacted laws  in five  other states  to reduce  the early voting  .  
for example , in  the general election  in florida  , 33  % in the early  voters ,  african @-@  americans who  were  ,  however ,  only 13  %  of voters  in the state .  
the same  applies to  latin americans  .  
these  are  only 11  %  of voters  , but  24 %  of citizens  who  voted  early .  
on the other hand ,  76 %  of voters  were  white  ,  but these  were just  46 %  of voters  early .  
of course ,  democratic  lawmakers  and  their supporters  vigorously opposed  the adoption  of laws  that restrict  the registration of voters  .  
several  bills  that were  blocked by  the veto  by democratic  governors .  
the united states  attorney general  intervened  to suspend  the most controversial  laws .  
part  they were able to  limit the damage .  
for example  , only  16 of  34 countries  have adopted  laws  requiring  the presentation  photo  id card  .  
however ,  the new rules  put  in place  ,  will certainly  make it  more difficult  to exercise  the right to vote  in 2012 .  
democratic  critics  condemn  fanatical  character of the  laws  that have been taken  , and  they see  a clear  goal of the  impact on the  2012  results  in key  states .  
in 2011 , the  brennan  center  report shows  that the countries that  were adopted  these laws  are  171 of the  270  electoral college  votes  needed  to  win the presidency .  
it is  too early  to say  with certainty that  these legislative  changes to the  electoral system  will have  a significant impact on  the outcome of  the 2012 presidential election  .  
but  one thing is clear  :  these new  provisions that  would have a negative effect  on the  move .  
in this sense ,  the measures  will be  partly  undermine  the american  democratic system  .  
prostate cancer screening  :  take the test  or  not ?  
indeed ,  the dog  @-@  test  sometimes  demonstrates the  erroneous  results with  false  negative  or even  false  positive results  , which include  unnecessary  medical  intervention .  
it is enough  to make the  already  reluctant  men  hesitate  to accept  screening  tests  .  
take  the test  or not  ? &quot;  
we asked  two  experts  for their  opinions .  
in research  conducted in the usa  , there were many  pollution  between the  control group  , so  it is difficult to  interpret the  data and  make  firm  recommendations .  
another study  , this time for  a european  , came  to the conclusion that  there is a huge difference  in  mortality rates  among patients  who  were screened  and those who  were not  .  
the study  also showed  ,  with further  after 12  years  , that it is  between  30 and  40 %  more likely  for  metastases  in the absence of  screening .  
therefore ,  i recommend  the test  from 50  years ,  or  40 ,  if you have a  direct  relative  , who  was previously  prostate cancer  .  
african @-@  american men  are also  more  at risk  .  
the key  is to  make the right choice  when the  cancer  was discovered  .  
there is  an aggressive  cancer and  others which are  indolent  .  
the patient  really  needs to be done  to understand  the extent of  his cancer  risk  by offering  him the  options ,  not necessarily  the treatment of  prostate cancer  , which are not  life threatening  and  long @-@ term  , deciding  instead , in  such cases  for active  monitoring  of the disease  .  
today ,  many of the men  ,  which  was detected  cancer  will not  cure cancer  , because  they are not  aggressive  and is not a  threat to  life .  
the active  monitoring will be  ,  and if  the disease  progresses  , they will  be offered  treatment .  
more and more  ,  the specific  criteria  are defined  in order  to decide  who should  or  should not  be treated  .  
therefore ,  i recommend  to take the  exam .  
but it is important  to discuss  with your doctor  to determine  whether  to accept  it .  
in cooperation with the  société  internationale  d  &apos;urologie  &#91;  siu  &#93; ,  movember  created a  tool that allows you to  evaluate the  pros and  cons of  dog  @-@  test .  
you can download the  document  ( in english  at the moment ,  &#91;  france  &#93;  translation  will be available  soon  )  at this address  : http  :  / /  ca.movember.com  / fr  /  mens  @-@  health  screening for  prostate cancer  /  
the disease  prevention  
unfortunately  , there is no  miracle  recipe  to prevent  cancer .  
despite the  progress in  research ,  to adopt  healthy  habits of life  remains  the best way to  reduce the risk of  suffering  from it .  
it is estimated that  if everyone  ate well  and  has  enough  , 30  %  from cancer  can be  prevented .  
&quot; if  people are no longer  smoked  ,  this figure  may increase  by at least 50  %  , &quot; says  andre  beaulieu  , a spokesman for the  canadian  cancer society  .  
on the other hand ,  it is estimated that  about 10  % -  hereditary  cancer .  
some of them  also  completely  inexplicable  .  
for  the canadian  cancer society  , the fight against  tobacco  remains a  priority ,  despite the decline in  the number of  smokers  .  
cigarettes  are associated with  85  % of  cases of  lung cancer .  
he is also a  risk factor  for  a number of  others .  
it is  irreparable damage  to human health .  
&quot; even  today ,  there are  1.5 million  smokers in  quebec  &quot;  regrets  the representative  andre  beaulieu .  
encouraging  data  : 10  years after  refraining  from smoking  , the risk of  death  from cancer  drops  by half  .  
the weight  ,  
overweight  and obesity  also contributes to  the emergence of  the disease  , according to the  scc  .  
they can  increase the  risk of  breast cancer  ,  colon  and  rectum  , esophagus  ,  pancreas  and  uterus .  
&quot;  research shows that  regular  sessions  of physical activity  throughout his  life ,  protects against  colon cancer  is  also said  .  
the diet  ,  
the organization also  recommends  to limit  their  consumption of  red meat .  
in large quantities  ,  it increases the  risk of developing  colon cancer  colorado .  
similarly  , as the  shell of  meat products  , and these  should be avoided .  
preservation of  the meat  from smoking  , drying  or treatment  can cause  the formation of  carcinogens  .  
&quot; they  can damage  cells  in the body  and  lead to the development  of cancer  , &quot; he explained  .  
the vitamins and  
in recent years ,  many scientists  have studied  the link between  vitamin supplements  and  cancer .  
at the moment ,  however , their  studies  are  inconclusive  .  
research  on  vitamin e  , are  contradictory  ,  according to  the  company .  
in  one study  , an increase in the  risk  of developing prostate cancer  , another  noted  the increase  .  
also ,  the effect of  vitamin d  to  cancer  is not  clear .  
in addition  , mr.  beaulieu  emphasizes  the importance of  discussing  their problems  and family  history  with the  doctor .  
&quot;  screening  test  doesn &apos;t give you  cancer  . &quot;  
the  higgs  бозоном  disclosed  
the announcement of the  discovery of the  probable  higgs  бозоном  created  a furore  last summer  , and  not without reason  .  
indeed ,  it is believed that  it is the  higgs  is part of the  mechanism  , which  is responsible for  all the  mass  in the universe  , not  less .  
it is also  the last  particle  whose existence  is  predicted by the  standard model  is our  better or  worse  &quot; less  &quot;  explanation  of nature  and  the behavior  of matter  - but  who  have not yet been  observed  empirically  .  
but for  physicists  , this is still  not completely  sure that  it really is the  higgs  .  
we know  without a  shadow of  a doubt  that  this is a  genuine  particles ,  and  strongly  resembles  бозоном  predicted by the  standard model  higgs  .  
in addition ,  new data  released  this week  on the  physics  of the congress  in kyoto  , seems to  confirm this  , but  there are still  not enough  data to  be absolutely sure  .  
but  let &apos;s  suppose that  it really is the  higgs  , because the  chances of being  wrongly  seem  insignificant  and see  what it is .  
in our world ,  there is  the  inevitable  law that  stipulates  that the  two things  can not  meet  at the  same place  at the same time  .  
there is no way  to break  this rule  - and  don &apos;t try  too  hard  ,  it &apos;s crazy  .  
however ,  although the  particle physics  is a very  strange  world ,  it turns out that  she also  has the right to  the same  kind of  :  pauli  exclusion  principle ,  which says  that the  two  particles  can &apos;t  occupy the  same  place  at the same time  , if  they are in  the same  &quot;  quantum  state  &quot; is a  &quot;  state &quot;  consisting  of about  some  of their  characteristics .  
as a result ,  physicists  classify  particles  into two  categories .  
in one corner  we have  good  citizens  called  fermions  , who  wisely  obey  pauli  principle .  
while the  others  are  bosons  ,  a  group of  anarchists  who  respect  nothing -  at least ,  not  this principle  , which means that  they really  can be found in the  same place  at the same time .  
these  bosons  then  divided into  two groups  , according to the  berkeley  labs  particle  adventure  site  ( absolutely  extraordinary  ,  by the way  )  : a  @-@  b mesons  , which  we will not  discuss  here ,  and &quot;  the forces of  particles  , &quot;  by which  the great  forces  of nature  ,  and  apply  the  higgs  бозоном  may be  somehow  linked .  
these  bosons  ,  it should be stressed  here ,  not all  such  exotic  errors ,  as you  think .  
indeed ,  if you  can read  this article  ,  it is thanks to  an extremely  banal  higgs  :  photon ,  or &quot;  light  particles  , &quot;  which is  &quot; the messenger  &quot;  electromagnetic  force .  
when  , in  fact ,  a particle  with  an electric  charge  accelerates  or  changing direction  , it &apos;s &quot;  offended  &quot;  electromagnetic field  in this particular  place ,  rather  like a  pebble  thrown in  a pond  .  
this &quot;  unrest  &quot; produces  electromagnetic  waves (  light ,  infrared  ,  ultraviolet  , etc .  ) ,  and  this wave  is  nothing less than a  photon  -  and thus  one of  the &quot;  forces of  bosons  carrier  . &quot;  
the more  stable  field  
the same  applies to  бозоном  higgs  ,  with the difference  that this is  another area  ,  the  field , which  should be &quot;  disturbed  &quot; for the  higgs  to appear  .  
now  it is the  higgs  field  is much  , much  more stable  than the  electromagnetic field  ;  to  the case  , it is necessary  to achieve  a very , very  high level of  energy ,  more closely resembles  the frozen  pond  , who  will need  a very big  rock  wrinkles  surface .  
that is why  the huge  particle accelerator at cern  - as one large  hadron collider  - the  ring with  27km  circumference  !  - it is necessary  to achieve  this level  of energy  .  
the analogy  with  electromagnetic field  again  useful  for explaining  the relationship between  the  and  mass .  
in fact ,  not all  particles ,  or all  the materials  to interact with  electromagnetic field  .  
some ,  such as  magnets  ,  do it  , but  others do not  -  a piece of  paper ,  for example ,  never  will  stick to the  refrigerator .  
and  in addition  , not all the  particles  interact  with the  higgs  field  : those  who have no  mass ,  while others  (  such as  the photon  ) does not  .  
now  that all  this research  &quot; may  bring  &quot; ?  &quot; asks  ms  plamondon  .  
for  science ,  it serves  to verify  the validity of the  standard model  (  cm )  , and  also allows  doctors  consider any  discrepancies  between the  observations  and forecasts  .  
the number of people  in addition ,  strongly  hope that  some  will be found  , because  the slightest  difference could  open the  door for  a &quot; new  physics  &quot; and  plug  some  holes in the  model .  
this ,  it must be said  , still  has a  huge  flaws  , offering  no explanation  of gravity  ( oops  ! )  or  dark matter  , which  is about  80 %  of matter  in the universe  (  re @-@  oops !  ) .  
but for now ,  there is no such  discrepancies  were found  at  cern  .  
the consequences  ,  
the consequences of  this study  in everyday  life of the man  on the street  -  it is hard  to predict ,  but it would be  a mistake  to assume that  they  will not  .  
remember :  in the  early  1960s  , the  pioneers  of laser  at  bell laboratories  did not suspect  the revolution that  could be caused by  their  work .  
they  suspect  the scientific  applications ,  but nothing  like  the rest  .  
indeed ,  the late  willard  boyle  , a  physicist  who  worked at  bell labs  , where the  laser  was invented  in 1960 ,  and who  he developed  the first  permanent  laser  ( first  were  накачке  )  in 1962  - told  us that  initially  laser  was  seen as  &quot; laboratory  gadget  . &quot;  
imagine  . ...  
and  then  , applications  may also  come from  all the devices  that surrounds the  research .  
for example ,  the same  willard  boyle  has developed  a small  sensor  light  in 1969 ,  during  his work  in optics  .  
this sensor  , although  it wasn &apos;t  the original intent  , now  serves as the  &quot;  eye  &quot; to  all  digital cameras  worldwide ,  and earned  him  the nobel prize  in physics  in 2009 .  
of course , this  does not mean that  the activities of  the lhc  will  transform  our lives  , but  it does mean that  , actually ,  you never know  ...  
palliative care  is the best way  to die  ... &#124;  not  
with his death  with dignity  commission ,  quebec  recently  discussed the  delicate  end of  life .  
the debate  is  due to  resume  shortly after  the bill  is preparing  .  
however ,  in this  vital  area ,  much remains to be  done .  
not  tried to  look more  closely  .  
just a few  weeks ago ,  mr l.  lived alone  in his  apartment  montérégie  .  
the  festering  prostate cancer  allowed  him a  two @-@ year  reprieve  .  
&quot; they gave me  five years  to live  , i  reached  seven  , &quot; he says  ,  with mixed  emotions ,  lying  in bed  on the  victor  @-@  gadbois  palliative care  home in  beloeil  , where  he arrived at the  previous day .  
&quot; but  it is another  shock  , you  can never be  prepared for  it  , &quot; he added  .  
the disease  does its job  : huge  weakness ,  which  prevents him  to go to  the bathroom  alone ,  and even  there  alone .  
sitting in front of  lunch  gatherings  , he  agrees that  they helped  to eat  , resigned  .  
the courageous  ,  he even  manages to  smile  , talks  with strangers  bustling  around him  , bringing  him medication  , offering  him  a bath .  
the courage  of ordinary mortals  .  
&quot; what  i want  most  can  cure my  diarrhea ,  it is  humiliating  , &quot;  he admitted .  
a few hours  later ,  the team  found a  cure for  this disease .  
&quot;  in our lives ,  we learn that the  man  pisses  standing  , &quot; says  pierre  brodeur  ,  a psychologist  victor  @-@  gadbois  home .  
in  his return  to the scene  of the child ,  for some people  ,  is unacceptable  humiliation .  
&quot; it depends on  the ability  of a person  to &quot; take  setback  , he said .  
because  , in the opinion  of many people  working in  palliative care  , great  moments  occur  in the heart of  such a  setback  .  
patients  at  victor  @-@  gadbois  palliative care  home  all  suffer from  cancer .  
they have the  maximum life span of  three months .  
at this stage ,  the team  of doctors  and nurses  surrounding  them  no longer provides  the so @-@ called  &quot;  therapeutic  &quot;  assistance .  
for  ms.  a.  ,  89  years ,  the worst  fears  -  die &quot;  conscious and  suffocating  . &quot;  
but the disease  has made me  discover  my children  .  
&quot; i have a  wonderful  children  , &quot;  she added  .  
&quot; i  don &apos;t want  nothing more  in life  , &quot; she says  , before taking  to  wear  a mask  to help her  breathe .  
she  looks  forward ,  however ,  in the next few  days ,  until the  last visit  to her  son  from italy  .  
victor  @-@  gadbois  ,  a group  of volunteers  provides  bodily  care and  help with  feeding  .  
it is a  palliative care  , given  when  there is nothing that  can be done .  
make the  death  more comfortable  .  
in quebec  , there is a  palliative care  beds  for  11,700  people .  
it is  very little  , when  we know that  we all  die in  one day .  
here ,  life goes on  in  the most  favorable conditions  , explains  dr.  christian  martel  , one of the  doctors  on the  house .  
on  the physical  comfort ,  emotional and  spiritual level  .  
the man who  dies  will  creatures  have helped  to drink  cognac  or  pepsi  , regardless of their  taiwan  beer market  .  
diabetics  ,  no longer need to  control  blood sugar levels .  
and death  is a part of  everyday life  .  
yesterday evening  , the  beer  was  served  to mr  x ,  who died  during the  night .  
this morning  ,  it is his  son  , who  will end  the beer  at the  feet  of late  .  
&quot;  we will help  the family  as much as  patients ,  &quot; says  natalie  savard  , director of  medical care  .  
victor  @-@  gadbois  home  one day  follows  another ,  but  no two  are alike  .  
along with the  93  @-@ year @-@ old man  who is  savouring  his last  meeting with the  family ,  firmly  sits  in his  pillows  , and  toasts  drunk  in  his honor  , the  36  @-@ year @-@ old  young man  dies  tragically  , surrounded by  his parents  , his wife  and two  small children  ,  after you  &apos;ve tried  everything to  survive .  
&quot;  within six  months ,  there have always been  three or  five  places  where  the  cancer patients  less than 45  years ,  &quot; says  dr.  concerned about  christian  martel .  
53 %  of patients  with viktor  @-@  gadbois  home  come  from their homes ,  47 %  from the hospital .  
the lack of  access to  palliative care  
it is said that  77  % of  canadians  simply do not have  access to  palliative care  , which  is  designed to  ease the pain  when  the patient  has entered the  final stage  of life ,  whether at home ,  at the hospital  or at  home .  
and a number of  organizations  , such as the  victor  @-@  gadbois  home and  palliative care  society in  the greater  montreal  specialize  more or less  exclusively  in medical  services for  cancer patients  .  
this is the  big  gap in  quebec  health ,  which has made  a series of  palliative care  doctors  are afraid  to adopt  a law on  euthanasia and  assisted  suicide  .  
since october  , the manifesto  signed by  palliative care  luminaries  , including  dr.  balfour  grief and  dr.  bernard  lapointe  ,  began to  circulate  to demonstrate  their  opposition to  such an  initiative .  
according to dr  christian  martel  ,  quebec  health system  is not  effective enough to  ensure  that everyone will  have the right to  quality  palliative care  before  it is  taken  to move to  euthanasia .  
recently  , she says ,  i saw  the patient  to spend  14 days  in emergency  situations ,  in  great  pain ,  without any  do  to alleviate its  suffering .  
i  am afraid  that the  patients  ask  to die  because they  do not receive  proper care  .  
and  at the same time  , some  oncologists  tirelessly  on  their patients  until  the last day  , despite  the worst  predictions  .  
hélène  richard  survival  hopes  have already been  minimal  , when  she  ended  her  grueling  chemotherapy .  
when i  announced  my  онкологу  that i was  stopping the treatment  ,  she told me  she  regretted  that i already  have abandoned  the struggle  , &quot; she said  .  
however ,  she told  me that i  was finished  .  
neither the  almighty  care  
dr.  martel  thinks that  90  % of patients  are asked  to die  thank  nurses  for  not  acceding  to their  request ,  after they  were released  from  their pain  on  palliative care  team .  
but  i must say that  palliative care  is not  all @-@ powerful  in the treatment of  pain .  
according to  elsie  monereau  ,  palliative care  director of  the  palliative care  society  in montreal  , patients  are resistant to  treatment  against the  pain  at 8  % of cases .  
at the very end  of life  , doctors  then  often  resort to  palliative  sedation and  that the  equivalent to  the patient  to sleep  until death  or  sporadically  or  forever .  
we can no longer  pretend  that  do not  understand  this part of  their suffering  .  
over time  , more and more  unrelieved  the patient  will be able to  carry out  such  palliative  sedation  .  
patients who  are not  released  always say  the same thing  : &quot;  i want to die  . &quot;  
but this does not  necessarily mean  &quot; i  want you to  euthanise  me , &quot;  which means  &quot; i want to  be released  . &quot;

widely  real estate  scandals in  quebec  
day after day  highway  officials ,  construction  contractors ,  political party  will mobilize  the resources  of the fund  and  the italian  mafia  experts say  that  they know  about the  grandiose  &quot;  system &quot;  that combines  the construction industry  ,  officials ,  politicians ,  trade unionists and  organized crime  .  
the &quot;  industry &quot;  that claimed  quebec  taxpayers  dearly  , especially in the  1990s and  2000s  .  
&quot;  it is curious  how the system  is collapsing  , because we took  decisive action  ,  &quot; says  jacques  duchesneau  ironically ,  quebec  politician  and former  police chief  montreal  .  
it is thanks to  him that  the scandal  in 2011 ,  in  an in @-@ depth  investigation  of corruption  related to  road construction  contracts  in quebec  , on which  the liberal  prime minister  jean  charest  , gave  consent  reluctantly  .  
&quot;  duchesneau  report &quot;  a direct link  between the  industry ,  under the hood of the  table  financing  parties and  bribery  of officials  .  
&quot; since  the investigation  began in  2010  , according to him  ,  the ministry of transportation  , reportedly  saved  one billion  dollars in  contracts  , &quot;  with some  people ,  curbing  their  instincts  to get  a share  .  
the  charbonneau  commission  &quot;  has already  shot down  two  mayors  , &quot; he added  , hoping  that this will  succeed  in &quot;  uncovering  the scheme  for the  people  . &quot;  
ongoing  anti @-@ corruption  unit  , created  in 2011 .  
the ongoing  anti @-@ corruption  unit  , created  in 2011 ,  also in  conjunction with  its army  of government  analysts ,  investigators  and  auditors .  
plus &quot;  marteau  squad  &quot;  police who  ,  starting in  2009 ,  apparently ,  headed  &quot;  montreal  &quot;  sewer  cartel  &quot;  soft  pedal  on inflation  contracts  ...  
in recent weeks ,  it  has carried out  a series of  searches and  charged with  fraud  and corruption  in the  municipal  politicians ,  such as  frank  zampino  and richard  маркотте  (  ethan  ,  mayor of  the  suburb of  the city  .  
next  on the list  is  apparently  gilles  vaillancourt  ,  who recently  resigned from  the mayor of  laval ,  the third  largest city  in quebec  .  
he is suspected of  pocketing the  repeated  bribes in  exchange for  public  contracts .  
the other  officially  accused  in montreal  highway  engineers  and italian  entrepreneurs  , including  tony  accurso  and  lino  zambito  .  
the latter  has caused  a sensation  , explaining  the mechanics of  government  contracts  &quot;  system &quot;  in the  commission .  
he  paid  3  % of the value of  the contract  obtained  in montreal  intermediary  linked to  the mafia  , which  , in turn ,  paid  the money to  the union  montréal  , mayor  gérald  tremblay  party .  
mr.  zambito  has already  handed over the  money  freely  in the  2000s  , giving  more than  88  million  canadian dollars  ( about  68  million  euros )  in the provincial  parties  , especially  liberals  then  in power .  
he also  admitted that  he organized  the illegal  fundraising  for former  liberal  deputy prime  minister  , nathalie  normandeau  .  
sewage  contracts with  inflated  price  
in montreal  , corruption  , &quot;  system &quot;  has gone  smoothly .  
gilles  surprising  , former  public works  engineer  ,  described  it in  the presence  of the commission  :  for ten  years ,  he received  from  construction companies  gifts ,  invitations to  travel ,  golf  tournaments  , restaurants  , hockey matches  and  a total  of $  736,000  bribes  in exchange for  sewer  contracts ,  of which  he  inflated  costs .  
the other  highway  officials  have acknowledged  that their  palms  greased  inflating  invoices  for 30  @-@ 40  % , and by  false  additions .  
then ,  as the  organizer  of the party  for mayor  martin  dumont  ,  accused  mr.  tremblay  of having  deliberately  closed his eyes  on  a parallel  budget  to feed  their coffers  with dirty  money .  
after these  revelations  , mr.  tremblay  resigned  in early november  , plunging  in montreal  , a major crisis  .  
chantal  rouleau  was one of the first  women  in montreal  to raise the  alarm .  
the mayor of  the city of  rivière  @-@ des @-@  prairies  ,  to the east of  the island  in 2010 ,  she  protested against  the sale of  municipal  land  bought  for  $ 5 million  , and  sold  for ...  1.6 million  for developers  ,  at the height of the  real estate boom  .  
70  % of  dirty  money in  the election campaign  
the  investigation  , which  eventually  will be realized  , she  says that &quot;  - after  the thread  to learn  how the system  -  have infiltrated  ants  -  is working  to put an end to  gangrene  and  catch  criminals  . &quot;  
the process  , &quot; she says  ,  is a  &quot;  painful  , but  positive  . &quot;  
rana  in  order ,  but  in montreal  will need  its own  investigative division  with the  constant monitoring  to prevent  the return of  these  questionable  practices .  
to clean  the  house  .  
right  . &quot;  
jacques  duchesneau  said  in turn  that  &quot; officials  stole  hundreds of millions of  dollars  , &quot;  but  he is  especially  concerned about  the role of  the &quot;  chosen  people  are aware of the  scheme  , &quot;  when they  were not  up to  the neck  in  a scam  !  
estimates of  the proportion of  dirty  money  to finance  election campaigns  in quebec  on 70  % ,  he says  drily  : &quot;  they told me that  it was  only a  pale  reflection  of reality  . &quot;  
in quebec  , the government  proposes  to limit  donations  to  parties  to 100  dollars ,  but it  will not change  the situation ,  he said  : &quot;  before the election  spending will be  strictly  limited ,  there  will be a  dirty money  in politics  . &quot;  
he  stands for  a complete overhaul of  the system  of government  contracts  and financing  of political parties  :  &quot; we can &apos;t  go  any  lower  ;  to get to the bottom  of things ,  with  courage ,  will help  to restore  the house  on more  solid foundations  ,  with more  control  and laws  . &quot;  
although  this story  the image of the  international image  of quebec  and montreal  , mr.  duchesneau  invites everyone  who  laughs  to look  in their own  backyard  .  
not  &quot;  paris st germain  fc barcelona  !  . &quot;  
this season  , you  have taken  on a  new position  with  paris st germain  .  
as  you read  this progress  ?  
this can  be explained  the individual  consciousness ,  but also  a new  dimension of  paris st germain  .  
some of the  great players  arrived .  
every day i  &apos;m making  progress  along with them  .  
technical staff  also  brought me  a lot .  
day by day  , all of these  things  will help me  to raise  their level  of play  .  
and ,  in a  match ,  it &apos;s  easier .  
all that  is moving  very quickly  in football  .  
but i don &apos;t  get  .  
my  debut in  clairefontaine  inf  pre @-@  training center  to  my  transfer to  saint @-@  etienne  ,  i always  moved  step by step .  
so you  benefit from  competition ,  привнесенному  carlo ancelotti  . ...  
this summer , the  new recruits  are accustomed to  playing  matches  at a high level  .  
they also  know  that every training session  is crucial .  
what makes  a player  as  i want to  face up  and give  my best  .  
on the other hand ,  carlo ancelotti  gives me  a lot of  as  my  position .  
he  supported by  deputies ,  as  claude  makelele  ,  who played  in the same  position  as me .  
ancelotti  is the  man for the job  ?  
certainly ,  .  
ancelotti  inspire respect  among all the  experts .  
today ,  he has no  equal  in  ligue  1  , and he is  one of the best  coaches  in europe  .  
he has  a lot of  experience and  won many titles  with the  top  clubs .  
he worked  with great  players  . &quot;  
i  think he  will bring  more titles  in  paris .  
in january  ,  i had  promising  discussions  with him  . &quot;  
i was  just back  from a  series of  injuries .  
the confidence that  he  gives me  also explains  my  performance  .  
how much  value  you  attach  to the  first part  of the season  for  paris st germain  ?  
in  ligue  1  , lyon  caught up with  us  at the top .  
but we  are waiting  on the sidelines  .  
one of our main  tasks -  champions league  : we  qualified  for the last  16  in the right direction  .  
what is the purpose  of the club  in this  competition  ?  
we will try  to get  as much as possible .  
from now on  , everything  can happen  .  
but we  have to  say something  against  some very  good  european  teams .  
first of all ,  we want  to finish  top  in our  pool  , ahead  of porto  ,  have  home  advantage in  the last  16  matches .  
psg  may become a  top  european club  in the short term  ?  
already has a  budget  ...  
to become a top  european  club  , paris  need to  win  titles  and stay  with the passage of  time .  
today ,  it is not so  .  
financially ,  paris st germain  have  the means  to make it happen .  
in  ligue  1  without winning  a title  , like  last season  ,  would be a big  failure ?  
certainly  , it will be  a big  disappointment .  
this year , we  really  wants to  win  the championship  .  
we  were not  far from  last season .  
in may ,  it was  a big disappointment  because we  were  good enough  to finish  first .  
it was  a stunning  season .  
we finished  with  79  points .  
as a rule ,  79  points  is  good enough to  be  top  . ...  
but another  team ,  montpellier  , were  even more  fantastic  season .  
&quot; i  think this  year .  
even if the  big teams  , for example ,  marseille  ,  lyon  , bordeaux  are fighting for  the title  , i think  we have the  weapons  to win .  
how do you think  that the media  expect too  much  paris st germain  ?  
it &apos;s normal  for them  to expect  that many  of us  , given that  has invested  and  the players  we have .  
we fully  accept  it .  
after  we won  4  @-@ 0  at home  against  troyes  , and  they still  have found  things  to blame  us  , it is certainly  a bit frustrating  .  
you wonder  that  more and more people  expect .  
you &apos;re  never  going to  win  4  @-@ 0  every weekend  .  
we are not  &quot;  barcelona  ! &quot;  
we &apos;re trying  to implement  the game  project .  
it takes time to  build a  team .  
the champions  league  proved that  we could  hold their  own .  
look at  manchester city  , who  for the past  two seasons  ,  failed to  qualify  for the last  16 years  , despite  also  having spent  huge sums  .  
based on the  amount  invested  , you must be  15  points  ahead  on winter  break  !  
it would be  to ignore  our  opponents and  the french  championship .  
lyon  , marseille  , who  did not have  last season  ,  were &quot;  shock &quot;  to the new  paris st germain  .  
this shows  that the  ligue 1  is  interesting .  
i hope that  in may ,  we will be able  to smile  that  ,  despite all the difficulties  , we  finally  did it  .  
paris st germain  seem  totally dependent on  the exploits of  zlatan ibrahimovic  .  
so much so that  people say  that there is a  &quot;  zlatan  dependence  . &quot;  
this means that  ibrahimovic  is very  successful and  scores  a lot of  goals .  
this is why  he came  , and  he proves  that he is  the star of  ligue 1  .  
he demonstrated  everywhere  he went  , that  he was a great  player  , world  star .  
within the group  ,  we respect  the person  and  a player  .  
and  he respects  the people  he has  around him  .  
what he  did it  for real .  
it  encourages  others  to raise the level  of the game  .  
thiago  silva  , who  is one of the best  defenders in the world  ,  also helps  the rest  of progress  .  
how did you get  on the euro  @-@ 2012  with france  team  ?  
it is  disappointment .  
i really  wanted to  play  in this  euro .  
unfortunately ,  my injury  prevented  me  from any  playing time  .  
i &apos;ve seen  some things  there and  came out  stronger .  
today ,  i play  well in the  qualifying  matches .  
this is what  i was  hoping  for  with my  baptism  with the  blues  .  
i learned  the lessons  from what  happened  in ukraine , and  now i  owe  it to  myself  to have  exemplary behavior  .  
what do you think about  didier  deschamps  the first few  months  in charge of the  blues  ?  
he  the results ,  he wanted  .  
we also  placed  in the world  qualifying  group .  
the coach  is a  tough  , close to the  players ,  and inspire them  to win .  
as  laurent  blanc  was .  
but i  don &apos;t want to  make any  comparisons  .  
blanc  had achieved  its goal  ,  when we  qualified  for the  euro .  
i hope that  didier  deschamps  will take  the blues in  brazil .  
good  draw  ( 1  @-@ 1  )  broke  in spain  ,  on october 16  , constitute  grounds for  the match  ?  
this match  has given us  confidence .  
all  fought for  each .  
before  the shock  in spain  , i have never  experienced  such a  match in  my career  .  
with the  bitcoin  together ,  pay  and sell  without  banks  
in contrast to  the current  currency  exchange  , based on the  central banks  , identified  deals  and processing  payments  between the parties .  
in addition ,  how often  in these  technologies ,  political vision  is clear :  the belief that  the current  monetary  system made up of  banking  monopolies ,  leads to  financial crises  .  
in fact ,  bitcoin  together  invented  сатоси  nakamoto  ( a pseudonym )  , is  as  a virtual  currency  (  but ,  convertible into  dollars ,  euros )  and secure  exchange  as  bittorrent  protocol  that allows you to  peer @-@ to @-@  peer  currency .  
about 200  thousand  deals  have already been  recorded  through  15 thousand  computers in the network  .  
almost  a thousand web sites  to accept  bitcoins  as  donations  or the  means of payment  .  
the  bitcoin  together  exchange rate  ,  reaching a peak of  30 dollars  ( 23  euros )  in june  2011  , fell to  2  dollars  five  months later  returned  today ,  about a dozen  dollars (  prices are  on the site  bitcoincharts.com  ) .  
nothing is  very impressive  , compared with  global operations  in real  currency or  financial products  .  
however ,  the european central bank  ( ecb  ) has taken  an interest  in his  report  on the  virtual  currency  published in  october .  
he  describes the  bitcoin  together ,  as &quot;  the most successful  virtual currency  , &quot;  &quot; in  competition with  the dollar  or  the euro  , &quot; and &quot;  similar to  the common  currency  . &quot;  
bitcoin  together  is different  from other  kinds of  virtual currency  , such as the  &quot; credit &quot;  for  the progress of  a video game  that  you win  by playing  or that  you can  buy (  and sometimes  currency  in return  ) .  
the social network  facebook  also  has developed  such a system  .  
but  on each  occasion  ,  the central organ  of control  and handles  exchanges .  
with the  bitcoin  together ,  all the  sites  on the web  are the custodians of  the book of  accounts ,  auditors ,  exchange of  issuers  and  buyers and sellers .  
how did  the network  work ?  
each  transaction between  two users  , actually  carried out  between two  e @-@ mail addresses  , as  with  e @-@ mail .  
in addition  ,  the user can choose  another address  for each  payment  , thereby  guaranteeing  anonymity  .  
a set of  information  related to  this deal  , signed in  electronic form  with  the dual @-@  key  encryption  system .  
thus ,  the network  can verify  the authenticity of the  deal .  
using  the contents of the file  may  also provide  exchanged  bitcoins  exist  in public  book  of accounts  ,  broadcast  across the  network .  
a key step  is entering  a new  deal  in the book .  
she  goes through  the decision  of a mathematical  task  for computers  , and  the winner  , a kind of  interim  central  banker ,  will be  able  to add  this  additional  lines .  
this  file  hashing  phase ,  that is  the transformation  of a large  file in  a shorter  and a unique  digital  imprint  .  
&quot;  computers  take  a &quot; new  deal and  add  next to him  ,  &quot; hash  &quot; everything  up .  
the aim  of the exercises  to find a  number that  gives  a special  imprint  (  lots of  zeros  in early  ) .  
when  this number  was found  , other  sites  can easily  check  that this is  the right one .  
the deal  will  then  indestructibly  associated with  the chain  of all  other operations  ; any  modification  would  change the  imprint  .  
if a user  wants to  deprive  by paying  twice  for the  same money  very quickly  ( less than 10  minutes )  , the  only  one of the two  deals  will be  approved by  the network  - another  will remain  an orphan  , as  two different  prints .  
a computer that  solves  the problem of  wins  50  bitcoins  .  
to avoid  inflation ,  this award is  regularly  divided into two  , probably  by the end of 2012  .  
the number of  bitcoins  in circulation  is  so  limited to  21 million  ,  but they  shared  until the  millionth  ,  which leaves  some  margin  ...  
the difficulty  is  also  raised  with the increase  in  computing power  .  
life  of the network  had its  ups and downs  .  
web sites  that provide  services for  bitcoin  together  were attacked and  bitcoins  in  deposits  stolen .  
&quot; the  loophole  is  not  the protocol itself  , &quot; says  pierre  noizat  reassuring  , who  has just released the  paymium  ,  the real currency  of payment  company that  uses a  network of  bitcoin  together .  
the ecb  also underscores the  opportunities for  money laundering  ,  using this  anonymous  .  
but  the money  also has  this weakness  .  
the big players  like  wikipedia  to refuse  donations  of this kind .  
others , such as  wordpress  blogging platform  ,  to take  them .  
recently ,  adi  shamir  and  dorit  ron ,  from the weizmann institute  in israel ,  analyzed the  books  and showed that  almost 80  % of  bitcoins  not  circulate  .  
in november , the  &quot; huge  sell @-@ off  &quot;  were launched  .  
&quot; thirty  thousand dollars  were exchanged  &quot; welcomes  jon  holmquist ,  who works  at the  coinabul  that  convert  bitcoins  to gold .  
pierre  noizat  ,  also  an  author of  a book  on this  currency ,  has a lot of  faith in  the potential of  this technology  as  the transaction  network .  
his  system ,  paytunia  ,  equivalent to  credit card  ( in  real money  ) or  contactless  payments  through  mobile  , but  it uses  bitcoin  together to  confirm the  deals that  thus  cheaper .  
in addition  , the user  runs  his  identity ,  and  so they  can be  anonymous .  
the system  is easy  to implement  traders  who  do not need to install  new terminals  or software  .  
they just  need to  provide the  address ,  phone can  &quot; photos  and recognize  , &quot; says  pierre  noizat  , which  confirms that  it has  thousands of  users .  
there is  a general  movement  to overestimate the  hierarchical systems  for more  horizontal  systems .  
&quot;  it will take time  for the  bitcoin  together to  become  firmly established  , but  in 2013  may become  a turning point , &quot;  he  predicts  .  
the ecb  , in  his report  , he says ,  will reassess  the various  risks  , currently  seen as  high ,  if successful  currency .  
we  came out of  afghanistan .  
what  now ?  
french troops  left their  areas of  responsibility  in afghanistan  ( in the  kapisa  and  surobi  ) .  
nato and the  americans have  due to  follow  at the end  of 2014 .  
it is time  for the  afghan army  to resume  their territory and  possession  of the afghan people  to choose  their future  , not  expecting  us to  do everything  .  
it is  mostly  afghan  farmers  that we should  be penalised  regarding  them as  terrorists .  
and  ourselves ,  with our  88  soldiers killed  and wounded  , lame  .  
the taliban  consists of  foreign  extremists ,  the former  leaders in  asylum in  pakistan ,  but often  peasants who  refuse to  the presence  of foreign  military forces  , as  in soviet times .  
they want to  protect their  traditions ,  such as  ancient  and archaic  , although  they  were joined by  jihadists  ,  pakistanis  , arabs  , uzbeks  ,  tajiks  .  
tolerated  , sometimes  helped  by  local  rebels ,  the latter  will no longer be  so when  the west  has become more  scarce  .  
the withdrawal  of french  troops from  nijrab  base ,  which i  watched  from the top  of the hills  миндальных  trees  with  french  finance  ,  was conducted  in an orderly manner  .  
convoys  of trucks  and  armoured vehicles  reached  kabul  without being  attacked  ,  they are  using  helicopters .  
will not be a  wave of  the taliban  in kabul  , by the end  of 2014 .  
the circumstances  have changed  after the  irresistible  advance  between  1994 and  1996 .  
at this time in  kabul  was empty  , in a country  torn by  a struggle  between different  factions .  
their  capture  of the country  were  perceived  as  a kind of  liberation ,  a return to  safety .  
afghans  paid the  price of  obscurantism  these  farmers  through  the organization of  al @-@ qaeda  , but  their situation  has not improved .  
the former  муджахидами  ,  the afghan government and  the  taliban  allies  of wanting  to keep  women in  the rankings  .  
chief of the  anti @-@ soviet  war  leaders  returned  to power  in 2001 .  
they have become  speculators  ,  seizing power  to  resell the  land for  the construction of the  land for  refugees  returning from  iran and pakistan  , benefiting  from  the huge  american  outsourcing  contracts .  
they were  discredited  ; indeed  , most of them  not  to fight  for themselves  .  
people ,  as i  have heard  in the countryside ,  want  a government that is  not  one of  the thieves  .  
many young  people want to  leave  , as  those who  will be able  to benefit from the  american  generosity  will leave  :  capital flight  is considerable .  
young people  are tired of  the war and its  ideology .  
they have  rubbed  shoulders  with  the modern world  during their  exile  in iran  and pakistan  , and  appreciated the advantages  .  
about 65  % of the population  is less than  25 ;  kabul  now  has 5  million people  ,  one @-@ fifth of  the population  .  
in cities  and  public schools  are  complete ,  with the  girls and  boys .  
it is necessary to provide  jobs  for those  young people  who do not want  to return to the  obscurantism  former  party  or corruption  of some  leaders .  
all of them ,  including armed  opponents  are  private  for mobile  phones ,  tvs  with her  turkish  soap operas  ,  show that  the modern world  , &quot; was his  everywhere .  
the army  now .  
will the  authorities  that  the team  is  considered  legitimate  ?  
the former  commanders of the  anti @-@ soviet  struggle  is already  thinking about  restoring  provincial  militias  that  would avoid the  central authorities .  
afghanistan  , a  land  of mountains  ,  with a strong  national identity  ,  should be able  to benefit from  some  decentralization  ,  in the image and likeness  of western countries ,  but the united states  wanted to  turn it into a  centralized  state ,  with a strong  presidential  power ,  abolishing  the post of prime minister  ,  which existed  from the  1964  constitution .  
president karzai  does not want  any  foreign  control ,  especially  on the occasion of  the elections  in april  of 2014 .  
but ,  since  the 1950s  and  has already  long before  his country  was  dependent on foreign aid  .  
there is no  industry  has been restored  , no  dams  are in good condition  ,  no significant  irrigation systems  have been rehabilitated  .  
all of  it is  imported  ;  nothing  except the  fruits and  vegetables .  
remains  a priority  for  private initiative  .  
in a country  destroyed by the  thirty years  war ,  government control over  infrastructure  , it would be  necessary .  
this  rumor  was  that afghanistan  has had  huge mineral  wealth .  
it is  only  heightened the  sense  that the  europeans were  only there  so as not to  miss .  
without the  energy for  processing of  ore  or copper  on the spot ,  or  vehicles  for  its exports  through the  mountains ,  not .  
the chinese  already  almost  left the  mes  aynak  copper mine  , leaving  international  archaeologists  (  funded by  the world bank  )  to search for a  huge  buddhist  site and  remain  the largest  employer  in the province .  
once she  , too ,  would be necessary  for afghanistan and pakistan  , which  is heavily dependent on  imports and  exports  to restore  normal relations  .  
the withdrawal  of french  troops  was completed  on november 20  .  
a new  cooperation agreement  provides for the  continuation of the  traditional  aid :  school  girls ,  boys ,  the french  department  at the university  , the french  institute ,  cooperation in  the military  , legal  , medical  and agricultural  fields ,  support for  archaeological  delegation .  
since 2009  to try to  &quot;  win the hearts and minds  &quot; and  achieving the  impossible task  of reconciling  assistance and  offensive ,  &quot; the  civil @-@  military action  &quot;  from the ministry of  defense (  cimic  ) ,  closed  in 2012 ,  has  and continues  to perform  successfully  , through  a small  french  ngos  , many  communities  and agricultural  rehabilitation  projects  in dozens of  mountain  villages .  
these projects  ,  with the participation of  a large number of  local  labor  ,  have helped  keep  the rebels  :  irrigation ,  wells  , drinking water ,  reforestation  , fruit  trees ,  soil protection and  increase in  part of  the  areas .  
what  we will  leave  as a souvenir  , after  two billion  euros of  military spending  ?  
a much more  modest  budget  will help to improve  local  living conditions  that are very difficult  in these  valleys  is often  more than 2,000  meters  above sea level .  
the embassy  has received  dozens of  written  requests  for small  agricultural projects  from local  communities in  kapisa  province .  
to be able to  get rid  of the uprising  led by  foreign groups  , which  is that  the farmers  told me  they want  a small number of  civilian  aid should  be preserved  in their favor  , well @-@  controlled  and  directly affects  them .  
the constitution  force  in egypt  
a new  adventure  for president  mohammed  morsi  .  
while  egypt  remains divided  more  than ever  around the  constitutional declaration  , which  temporarily  grants  his  powers ,  he decided  to go for  broke  .  
taking  everyone by surprise  ,  he announced  on wednesday  that the  constituent assembly  will  vote  on  the final  text of  the next day .  
only a week ago  ,  the head of state  gave  the assembly  another two  months  to complete  its work  .  
within two years ,  egypt  relied on  temporary  text ,  amended  several times ,  and it  has weakened  the institutional  stability and  led to  legal  imbroglios  .  
this new  initiative  has led  only  to  widen the gap  in the country .  
according to his  opponents ,  the president is  insistent  in his  &quot;  autocratic  nonsense  , &quot;  continues to  &quot; go back  on  his word  &quot; and &quot;  попирают  law  . &quot;  
his supporters  argue that  it is  the fastest way to  put an end to the  institutional and  political crisis  ,  speeding up  the process of  transition .  
the referendum  must  be held  within the next two  weeks .  
in a very short  period ,  which makes  the brothers  to abandon  his plan  to explain  the text  of article  by  article ,  egyptians  .  
for the president  ,  it is also a  way to achieve  the popular  and democratic  legitimacy  , although  the dispute  goes  across the country .  
mohammed  morsi  , it seems ,  are convinced  that the  egyptians  will vote  conveniently  , as  he said  in an interview with  the us  weekly  time  .  
especially  after a hasty  vote  smacks of  egyptian people  an ultimatum  : &quot;  either  you vote  for my  texts ,  or  i keep  powers ,  &quot;  these forces  allegedly  expiring  after the adoption  of the constitution  .  
it was  a  strange  atmosphere  that the  85  @-@ member  constituent assembly  ,  with large  islamist  majority ,  voted  for the  text  yesterday .  
majority of  the liberals  were lost  .  
in  mid @-@ november ,  shortly before the  constitutional declaration  , they  slammed  the door  , feeling  they failed to  approve  their views  .  
representatives of human rights  ,  religious minorities  or  civil society  was done  likewise  .  
in order to get  a quorum  , 11  members ,  deputies  were  hastily  added  yesterday morning  .  
some of them are  very close to the  muslim brotherhood  .  
it is not surprising  that the  articles were  for the most part  voted  unanimously .  
commentators  were also  surprised that  the only  sabotage  the day  was expressed  in terms of  ...  an hour  of prayer  ,  some members  of the committee of  the feeling that  the constituent assembly  clock  was wrong  .  
the text  , which  was still  being  voted  on  yesterday evening  , already  234  articles .  
the main  focus  of attention  , article 2 ,  remains  ultimately the  1971  constitution  , stressing that  &quot;  the principles  of sharia  are the main source of  law  . &quot;  
the salafist  party ,  for which  the establishment of  islamic law  is the main  claim  ,  had hoped  to replace  the &quot;  principles  , &quot; &quot;  rules &quot;  that would allow  tougher  statements .  
for the  islamists ,  the fact that  this article  was not  changed  is a guarantee of  their  goodwill  and respect  to other  elements of  egyptian society  .  
the &quot;  hypocrisy  &quot;  response to  liberals who  see only  the communications  revolution .  
because ,  in their view ,  the islamization of the  constitution  is done  through  other  articles .  
they  include  , in particular ,  article  220  , which  provides the  al @-@ azhar university  advisory  role ,  with particular emphasis on  tests in  accordance with  sharia law  .  
according to  egyptian  specialist  sophie  pommier  ,  it is  alarming  because &quot;  people are  called on  to  advise that  are not elected ,  and  have no  democratic  legitimacy .  
this suggests  the beginning of  theocracy  . &quot;  
the liberals  &apos;  fears  also  have been fuelled  by the fact that  the next  chancellor  of the university  will probably be  much more  moderate  than the current one .  
&quot; at the moment  there is no  specific  religious  overtones  .  
with this  constitution ,  things  remain  under  civilian  rule .  
most lawyers  who have worked  on  this text  is not  islamic law  scholars ,  academics  , some  trained  in the french  system &quot;  qualifies  alexis  blouet  who  wrote  a thesis on  the egyptian  constitution  of the transition .  
but  he admits that  &quot; maybe  there is some  uncertainty about  the article  220  , because the  terms used  on loan  with religious  terms .  
the link  is made  , in particular ,  &quot;  fiqh  &quot; &#91;  islamic jurisprudence  ,  ed  .  &#93; .  
and  this question  may be offered  in the future ,  the extent to which  the civil  judges  are competent  to pronounce  on it . &quot;  
for its  religious aspect  , the  text on  the vote  yesterday  highly  criticized  in connection  with  broad powers  , it  gives the president  of the republic .  
the brothers  say they  are significantly reduced  compared  with what  they were  under the  former  regime .  
another  question :  of the powers conferred  on the  army .  
in accordance  with the wishes  of the military  , the  defense budget  will be  submitted to the  parliament  , but  the national council  for the  defense .  
neither the  trials  of civilians  will be  banned in  military  tribunals  ,  at the request  of the association  for the protection  of human rights .  
who  voice  their concerns  about the  text  , which  they consider  repressive  .  
the crime of  blasphemy  is supported and  insults  now  smoking ,  which could  have serious  implications for  freedom of speech  , especially  for the press .  
in addition ,  no longer  makes  any of  the articles  are related to  the protection of women  ,  said  heba  morayef  , of  human rights watch  .  
in her opinion ,  the only  positive element  is the  ban on  torture  in article  36 .  
the word  was not included in the  previous  constitution .  
although the  egyptian president  said  last night  on tv  ,  rallies  are planned for  this day  .  
supporters  of the head of state  will  march  on saturday  .

only &quot;  the high  and the  mighty  &quot;  do it  to moscow  :  migrants  save money on  language  
so far ,  lawmakers  and  human rights activists  say about  the purpose  of the law  on mandatory  language testing  , the country already  fraudsters  who  sell  fake  certificates .  
every year  ,  13 million  migrant workers  are coming  to moscow  , st. petersburg  and other  russian cities  .  
mostly  it  citizens of the  central asian countries  :  uzbekistan ,  tajikistan and  turkmenistan .  
their only  goal is  to earn  money  to support the  families  back home  .  
the new law  came into force  on december 1  , which obliges  each  migrant worker  to pass  a test  in the russian language  .  
for the moment ,  this law  only applies to  those who intend to  work  in services  ,  housing and  utilities  , domestic  services and  retail trade  .  
but with  the passage of time  - as  promised  by the federal  migration service  - testing  will be  mandatory  for all  non @-@ residents  .  
in addition to the  language ,  history of  russia and the  basics  of the legal system  will be  tested  .  
knowledge of the  language  should be confirmed by  both  receive and  extend the  work permit .  
an exception  is in  force only  for the citizens of  countries where  english  is the  official language  .  
people who have received  education and  diplomas  , certificates  before the  collapse of the soviet union  in 1991 ,  also  released  under the  law .  
goal ,  doomed  destiny ,  and the  protection of human rights  
the seven  test  points  will work  under the auspices  of the institute  of the russian language  name  pushkin ,  peoples &apos; friendship university  of russia ,  moscow state university  ( msu  ) , st.  petersburg state  university (  spbgu  ) and  other russian  institutions  .  
migrants  can pass  the tests  in all  cities ;  more than 160  such  centers  were opened  .  
the initiative  to introduce  testing  was supported by the  deputies  of the state duma  and  the federal  migration service  .  
however ,  human rights activists  ,  asked a  question that  many times  in the press  before  the law  came into effect  :  what will it  achieve ?  
what will be  required to  know  the russian  changes  for the russians  and for  non @-@ residents  ?  
first ,  according to  representatives of the  migration service  , it  would reduce  the number of people  suffering from  labor  slavery .  
many say  about the  protection of the rights of  migrant workers ,  explains the  head of  the federal  migration service  , viktor  sebelev  .  
the protection of human rights  must begin  before  his retirement  .  
only  the system  organized  selection  will allow us to  solve the  problems of  90 %  of foreign  workers .  
migrants  without  profession  , education  who do not know  the russians  who do not have a  medical certificate  to start  there are  problems .  
if  a migrant  does not understand the  language ,  &quot; says  sebelev  with confidence  , he  is doomed  to come  through the  unscrupulous people  who are  trying to  help ,  will make  his &quot;  ticket  &quot; for  grozny  , cramped  barracks  , where  many others  like  him  will suffer  without food  and documents  , a  party of  12  @-@ 14  hours a  day .  
we get  a lot  of complaints  from our  migrants .  
&quot;  they promised  one  at home ,  but when  they come  , they  lied  , their  passports  , they are not  paid  what they were promised  , &quot;  confirms the  head of  migrant labour  administration of the  migration service  tajikistan  tolib  sharipov  .  
don &apos;t  be angry  , boss  !  
nevertheless ,  many  citizens of  the countries of central  asia  , which  are planning  to go to  work in  russia ,  recognize that  not only  their understanding of the  language of  the country in which  they are  not so  good ,  but they  can hardly  write  in their own language  .  
of course , it &apos;s  not  their fault  , but because of  poverty  :  very few  turks ,  uzbeks and  tajiks  can afford  even  basic education .  
their families  don &apos;t even have  food to feed  their children  , not to mention  a decent  clothes , shoes  and  supplies .  
after  reaching  adolescence  , these children  go  to work  at the first opportunity  .  
it is difficult  , if  knowledge of the language  is  bad ,  they recognize  .  
&quot;  you feel  humiliated and  worse  . &quot;  
however ,  human rights activists  say  one important  point  about the  law on  language .  
the tests will  be carried out only  for those  migrants  who have  legal status .  
if they  have no status  will not be  testing  , no  official  work  in the future .  
meanwhile  , the majority  of migrant workers  continue to  live  in russia  illegally .  
&quot; welcome  , or  unauthorized  entry  &quot; no  
many foreigners  say they  have received  official status  in our country is  not so simple .  
the reason is the  bureaucratic red tape  and the already mentioned  language  difficulties .  
in addition ,  the legalization of  costs money  : from  12 to  16 thousand  rubles .  
while the  fake  registration  is done  quickly and  costs just  one and a half thousand  .  
employees of  the russian  police  know that we  basically  were  fake  documents  without registration ,  hence the  extortion .  
&quot; they  are asking for  a century  or two  on  cigarettes ,  tea ,  &quot;  umed  khushkadamov  ,  a citizen  of tajikistan  ,  shared with  journalists .  
&quot; roll up  ,  may not be  cheap  to get  their  works of art  . &quot;  
on the first  day of the  law came into force  ,  it turned out that  not only  migrant  registration documents  may be  fake .  
several  fake  certificates  on the  language  tests were  seized by  the federal  migration service  officers  already  .  
fake  documents are printed on  a  color printer  .  
naturally  , they were not  free for  their owners  :  each of the  migrants who  had hoped  to  ease the  task of  passing the  tests  thus  paid  seven thousand  rubles for  them .  
it is  two and a half  times more than the  official  process  of testing  , which costs  three thousand  .  
government officials  and  human rights activists  agree that  the main goal  in the near future  to protect  the system  from corruption  , so that the  certificates that  simply can &apos;t  be bought  .  
for the moment ,  the authorities can  promise  of migrant workers  who could not  pass the  exam  the first time  , to allow time  for the  completion of the  basic  language courses  .  
in addition  , those who  came  without the  knowledge  of the russian language  will be offered  work in  areas  that do not require  the active  communication  with people .  
the interior ministry  did not  put  his hands  from the  illegal  market  back into  circulation  
the share of  crimes  related to the  legal  weapons of  extremely low  
the russian ministry of  the interior  offers  to tighten  up  the law  for owners of  civil weapons .  
this is  the reaction  of the authorities  on the  recent  incidents  : click  shots  at weddings  , where  there were no  casualties ,  and the  massacre  at  the moscow  lawyer  dmitry  vinogradov  , resulting in  the  deaths of  seven people .  
the police  want  a ban on  carrying weapons  in public places  and take up arms  licensing  aged 18 to  21 years  .  
the idea  was supported by  the head of  the duma committee on  security and  combating  corruption  irina  yarovaya  , who  promised  that the  amendments to the law on  weapons  will be  submitted to the state duma  anytime soon .  
not everyone is  happy with  the fact  that the russian authorities  are trying to  deal with  this problem  &quot;  tighten the screws  . &quot;  
the internet  appeared  open letter  whose authors  -  representatives of  various public  organizations from  rifles  - require  to abandon  tightening  &quot;  meaningless  . &quot;  
the proportion of  crimes  related to  the registered  weapons  is minimal  , said  criminal  lawyer  vasily  forest rangers  for the  russian air force  .  
according to the ministry of  internal affairs ,  according to statistics ,  142  crimes  using  firearms  registered  with the law enforcement agencies  were committed  during the six months  of 2012  , while  1,168,000  crimes  were recorded  a total of  over this period .  
the authors  of the open letter  are confident that the  tightening  of the law  in the sphere of  civil weapons  will not prevent  criminal  with access to  the black market  .  
according to them ,  you can find  any weapon  at a low price  right now  .  
nevertheless ,  the interior ministry  said  that the situation  with the proliferation of  illegal  weapons  is under control  .  
suppliers  : from  plants  for  officers  
the &quot;  black  market  weapons  will be recharged  through  several  channels .  
there are  five such  channels ,  explains  retired  colonel  viktor  baranets  , who worked  in the ministry  of education  and the  general staff  within 10  years .  
a screenshot  of the site  ,  which is  taking orders for  weapons .  
the first  : &quot;  the army  or  military extraction  , &quot; meaning  weapons  that  were stolen  during the fighting  in the caucasus .  
&quot; the  weapons  were stolen  russian  officers and  caucasians  , &quot; said  baranets  .  
the  &quot; black  weapons  , &quot;  kidnapped by  criminals  from  representatives of the  defense  ministries .  
baranets  explains that  these weapons  from  police ,  warehouses and  those  stolen  directly from  law enforcement officers  . &quot;  
illegal weapons  are  sold  with the  military  warehouses .  
often  could be heard  explosions  at military  warehouses .  
&quot; there are  proven  theories  that some of the  fires  were  intentional  to cover  the deficit  , &quot; says the  former military  .  
weapons manufacturers  to contribute to  ,  according to  baranets  .  
&quot;  there are so many  private arms  factories  , which do not  withstand  competition  on the international market  and  to stop  weapons  from under the  counter  on the black market  , including  in moscow  , &quot; he said  .  
another source of  &quot; black  market  &quot;  human trafficking  .  
especially  a large number of  guns  come  from poor  countries like  kyrgyzstan .  
&quot; there is  production  there ,  sometimes  handmade  ; and  formed a  mafia ,  which  organized  the flow  , &quot; explains  the former  military  .  
the  weapons  ?  
the experts have  the approximate  percentage of  each of the  sources  of supply  of illicit  weapons  on the black market  .  
this was  prepared  at the  heart of the problem  of analysis  and planning  of government  in 2011 .  
the experts  reviewed the  records  of the ministry of  internal affairs  and the  rosstat ,  criminology  literature  and open  data from  portals  on arms .  
the vast majority of  illegal  weapons  , according to the  researchers ,  comes from the  military and  security forces  .  
half of all  weapons  on the black market  is &quot;  because of the  officials ,  whose work  is associated  with weapons  , &quot;  the report said .  
according to the  researchers ,  17  % of the time  weapons  from  armed conflict  areas ,  14 %  is  theft  during  production ,  5  % -  &quot; black  archaeologists  . &quot;  
the seller  @-@ consultant  of one of the  weapons  stores  who wished to remain anonymous  , said  that the weapons  found the  &quot;  black &quot;  diggers  don &apos;t buy  more because  they are  too old  .  
he said the  dealers  to go  on  a military arsenal  for the  new party  goods .  
one piece  , for example ,  you can buy  a gun  cocking  warrant  officer .  
it is issued  to him , and  given the  fence  .  
&quot; he  takes  it to the  city and  sells  for  900  euros  per share  with two  magazines  , &quot; he says  .  
&quot; the truth  is that  the police  are already aware  of everything  , so  from time to time  , when  the percentage  is low  , it  is verifying  purchases from  illegal  arms dealers  , &quot; says  the consultant  .  
&quot; as  the store  &quot;  a luxury  
the buyer  and  the seller  often  find  each other  through  friends .  
i looked at the  websites ,  blogs ,  until someone  responded  by offering  me  go  begovaya  station  , where  people  will be waiting for  me  to take  me into  the &quot;  corner  &quot;  so that we can  negotiate  .  
i learned  the price of  weapons  only there  
the commentator  viktor  baranets  military  
to obtain  weapons ,  i need  people  with connections  , says  consultant on  sales .  &quot;  i have a  friend  , but  i &apos;m not sure  that it is  reliable  .  
there are  sellers  in labour markets  , but  need to  &quot;  come &quot;  conditionally  &quot;  with john  doe  , who  asked  to talk  about what  his daughter  had lost  a tooth  . &quot;  
now ,  even if  i need  some  knuckledusters  ,  i get  them through  someone  i trust  .  
he also  gives them  only for  me because  he knows that  i &apos;m not giving him  away  .  
newcomers  to search for  weapons  differently .  
the former  military  viktor  baranets  tried  themselves as  a buyer  of illegal  weapons in  the mid @-@ 1990s  , when  he was preparing  to publish  an article  about it .  
the formula  - all  the same  , he said  .  
he received  the album  with pictures  , &quot;  and all  . &quot;  
&quot; i  felt  in  a luxury  store  , &quot; he recalls  .  
according to  baranets  ,  the buyer does not  offered  a pig in a poke  - you  can try  everything .  
i ,  a potential customer  ,  not just  buying  ;  we went  into the forest  with the seller  and  set  the goal  there .  
&quot; i  had  the opportunity  to shoot  , and when i  am sure  that the  weapon  is good ,  we start  to negotiate  , &quot; said  the expert .

the military  commentator  and former  military  viktor  baranets  
i heard  about this  :  usually  the site  is registered  outside the  area of  the applicability of  the laws of  russia .

the buyer  pays  in the  atm .  
&quot; in  response ,  the photo  is sent  with instructions on where  hidden  weapons  , &quot; said  a spokesman for the  rights to  weapons  non @-@ governmental organizations  dmitry  kislov  .  
viktor  baranets  confirms that  after leaving  an application  on the site  you can  stay  without arms  and go to  jail .  
the federal security service  now  covers  a large  network of  fake  sites and  there are  plenty of  potential buyers  of military  weapons .

fast @-@ food  and  supermarket  workers  on  strike  in  the u.s.  
up to  a quarter of all  american teens  worked with  cash  in the  mcdonald &apos;s  at one time or another  
in the last few  days ,  there is  a wave  of protest in  the united states  against  low salaries  in supermarkets  in  walmart  chain and  popular  network  of fast food restaurants  such as  mcdonald &apos;s ,  burger king  ,  taco  bell ,  wendy &apos;s  and  kentucky fried chicken  .  
now ,  no one can predict  whether  this wave  will become the  ninth  wave  , or is it  destined to  weary  early .  
actions  must be  supported by  unions and  a number of  left @-@ wing  organizations .  
in addition to the  increase of  low wages  received  by employees of  walmart  and  fast food chains  ,  the aim  of the protesters  is the establishment of  trade unions  in them .  
this sector  of the economy  is not  covered by  the  trade union movement .  
the 46  cents  per year  ?  
the action  began  last week  after  thanksgiving day  , on  black  friday  , when  the mass  sale  drew  millions of people  in america  , sometimes  accompanied by  clashes .  
on this day  , some  employees of  walmart  corporation ,  which  has  2.2 million  people around the world  , have left  their jobs and  took part in the  picket  , along  with trade unions  and  left @-@ wing  activists  from  corporations  shops  that sell  products  for people  with low  and middle  incomes .  
walmart  sells  all possible  , from  diapers  ,  hunting  rifles  and  car  batteries ,  vacuum cleaners ,  eggs and  milk .  
the products  in  their stores  on average  8  % to  27 %  cheaper than  in large  supermarkets  .  
so  many  low @-@ wage  workers ,  walmart  store  only at  his  workplace .  
availability and  range of  walmart  has made  one of the  largest u.s.  corporations .  
critics said that  walmart  can  afford to  sell  products  cheaply  ,  partly because  he pays  little  for their employees .  
these last  also complain about  the difficult  working conditions  , for example ,  the lack of  loaders  and  hand @-@ held  scanners  .  
the protesters  on  black  friday  demanded  higher  wages and  complained that  the cost of  health insurance  provided by  the corporation  went  from 30 to 100  dollars a month .  
a typical  walmart  employee  , earning  $  9.5  per hour  ,  cannot afford  it .  
scientists  from the university of  berkeley  in california  argue that if  walmart  raises  the average salary  to 12  dollars  per hour  ,  it would cost  the company  $ 3.2 billion  .  
it is  about  1.1 %  more than it  spends on  salaries  right now  .  
if  walmart  full  shifts  costs  to increase  wages  on the  shoulders  of consumers  , each  visit to  the store  would cost  a total  of 46  cents .  
in  one year  , they will  only  spend  $  12.39  more  than now .  
walmart  supporters  gleefully  note that the  protests  were held  in nine  states and  won &apos;t cause any  damage  at all  to the  corporation .  
black friday  continued  at its stores  from 8  p.m. to  midnight  on thursday  on the next day  , and  during the  walmart  has sold  about 5,000  products  seconds .  
in general  , its  cash  spent almost  100 million  deals  on  black  friday  .  
a spokesman for  the corporation  , dan  fogelman  , said  in an interview  with the  left @-@ wing  site the  huffington post  that a total of  &quot;  less than five  &quot;  walmart  employees  left the  workplace  , and  to protest  the act  was just  &quot;  another  pr  stunt  &quot;  union  , which  organized  it .  
the &quot;  free cash  register  ! &quot;  
protests continued  this week  in new york city  , where the  object  was not  walmart  (  they are not  so  happy  in  progressive  cities ,  so they  don &apos;t exist  here  yet )  , but  mcdonald &apos;s  and other  cheap  restaurants .  
mcdonald &apos;s  says he  sells  billions of  portions  ,  and ,  despite this ,  it doesn &apos;t even  give you a  hospital  or pay  you for  work  !  
jumaane  williams  , a member of the  city council  of new york  
at the moment ,  the minimum wage in  accordance  with federal law  and new york  is  $ 7.25  per  hour .  
fast food restaurants  to increase it  over time ,  but very  little .  an average of  their  rank @-@ and @-@ file  employees  in new york  to earn  $  8.90  per hour  .  
no one  earns  less  in this  expensive  city .  
i can &apos;t understand  how you can  survive  in new york  on this  money .  
once upon a time  , almost  a quarter of  american teenagers  went through  mcdonald &apos;s  , working  part @-@ time  after school  , lives  with her parents  .  
few people  saw  it  as a source of  life or  are planning  to stay  here  for a long time .  
now i always  come through the  interview with  mcdonald &apos;s  employees  who  complain that  they have  to survive  on this  salary  , and sometimes even  to feed their  children .  
on the other hand  , there is a  comment on  the wall street journal  of the forum  , whose  author  notes that  it is  irresponsible  to have  children ,  if you  don &apos;t know how  you &apos;re going  to feed  them .  
participants in the  protests  , which  began at  6 : 30 a.m.  on thursday  near the  mcdonald &apos;s  on  the 40th  street and  madison avenue  demanded  cashiers  and  cooks  from  fast food  chain  paid  at least  $ 15  per hour  , that is  twice that  today &apos;s  salary  .  
they also  demanded  the creation of  trade unions  in the  fast @-@ food  industry  .  
american  law prohibits  the administration  from  to prevent  or punish the  activists  of the trade union movement  through the  agonizing  or dismissal  .  
on the other hand ,  the administration does not  often  ease their  lives .  
but  due to the  difficult to cover the  fast food  with the union  .  
one of them is  unusual  turnover of  employees .  
not  consistent  
noisy  protests  began  on that day in  a number  of other  cheap  restaurants  in manhattan .  
the highlight  of  the day  was  a rally  at the  mcdonald &apos;s  in times square  , where  several  local democratic  politicians  spoke out  .  one of them ,  jumaane  williams  , said : &quot;  mcdonald &apos;s  claims that  he sells  billions of  portions  ,  and ,  despite this ,  it doesn &apos;t even  give you a  hospital  or pay  you for  work  ! &quot;  
the demonstrators  supported  other  prominent  new york  democrats ,  like bill  de  blasio  , a  candidate for  mayor  of new york ,  who said : &quot;  we need  the voice of  our joint commitment  of fast food  workers  , so they can  get  a fair  wages and  economic prosperity  that  every  resident  of new york  deserves  !  . &quot;  
according to the  new york times ,  this was the largest  event  of its kind  in the history  of the american  fast @-@ food  industry .  
but only  a few  hundred people  took part  in it  , and many of  them were not  fast @-@ food  employees ,  who make up  tens of thousands of  people in  new york .  
it is unclear whether  it is  now  spark  mass movement  .  
&quot; at the moment  , the mind  can not  be deceived  too good  . &quot;  
among the  modern technology  fans of the  popular topic  is  augmented reality  , lately  seen  primarily  through the prism of  special  glasses .  
first ,  the functional  model  was shown  by google  in the summer  at its  annual conference  .  then ,  in november  , it was announced that  microsoft has  applied for  a patent  .  
however , according to  talk  with the leader  of a group of  interactive  3d  technologies  in cambridge  laboratory of  microsoft ,  shahram  izadi  , glasses  -  the past  for scientists  in this  company .  
they are  attracted by the  prospect of trying  to manipulate  virtual  objects  in the air  with their bare hands  , creating a  virtual  open spaces .  
&quot; tell  them  ,  simply put ,  the work of  your  research group  .  
&quot; we  are working on  the interaction  of people  with cars  , at the same  time trying to  expand  the boundaries  of this  interaction .  
while the  general people  stuck  in working with the  pixels  on  a flat  screen and  sometimes  pointing to  them .  
we want to  look at  5  @-@ 10  years into the future  and  predict the  dramatic changes  in  this interaction  .  
for example ,  the xbox  and  kinect  sensors  ,  is a step  forward .  almost  is not for sale  without the  xbox  kinect  today  because everyone  likes  to control  with  gestures  .  
what else  is  waiting for  us in the future  ?  
&quot; despite the fact  that the  kinect  moved  interaction  on a physical level  ,  much still  occurs on  a flat screen  , sometimes  in 3d  .  
the  information  has improved  ( system  gets more  data )  ,  but still  needs to  improve .  
we are trying to  change that  by working  on  a  three @-@ dimensional  display  system ,  based on  different technologies  , including  projection  technology .  
we must  let the  computer world  in our  physical world  , make  it more  tangible .  
but  for this  we need  to determine how  the user  and  the space  around him  .  
then we can  complement the  real world  with virtual  objects in  a much more  convenient form  .  
first of all ,  to get rid  of these  stupid  virtual reality  helmets  !  
&quot; what  do you think about  the voice  control  ?  
it is a very  popular  thing ,  but it  overestimated  ?  
&quot; it  certainly  is not a  cure  for all  - there is  the issue of  privacy ,  because we don &apos;t  always  want to  let  others  know about  our actions  and intentions  .  
in fact  , all  kinds of  interaction with  computers  are good , but  each  in its  niche .  
for example  , we have a  project to  control  devices  in public places  where  we thought  about the  movements  , not  a broad  movement ,  but  small  ,  reserved .  
the movement  was not  recorded  on camera  , but  on the  bracelet  that  identified the  movement of the  bones and  muscles .  
this is a big  right now  , but  in theory  it  can be reduced to  the size of  the hands of  the clock  .  
in general  , the future  lies at the heart  of the joint control  , for example ,  the movement  +  voice .  
&quot; what  do you mean ?  
&quot; for example ,  how would you  ask me  to give you this  a bottle of water  ?  
you will  speak and  show  at the same time  .  
&quot;  i usually  just  say  .  
&quot; oh  , it will be  very difficult to  detect .  
&quot; so  you want to make  users  to adapt  to what  the car  may or may not  do  at that moment ?  
&quot; not  necessarily  ,  but it is a  mutual  approach  .  
i think that in  the near  future ,  we will  mainly  work on  developing new  sensors  that allow  a more  precise definition of  human  reaction .  
it may  be , for example  , laser  sensors  .  they have  a decent  depth of  resolution  , which  is very important .  
&quot; if  we &apos;re talking about  your work  with the  xbox  kinect  sensors  ,  what are your  complaints  on modern  cameras  ?  
is not enough  resolution  , depth  or  something else  ?  
&quot; in general ,  the current generation  is that  we can  to base  themselves in  work on  three @-@ dimensional  recognition .  
of course ,  it would be good  to have  eight  megapixels  with  1,000  k  / s  speed .  
it is not just  the mega  pixels  , though  , but  the quality  and  depth .  
from this point of view  , all the  modern technology  is not good enough  for us  - it  adds  algorithm  designers .  
therefore ,  it is important to remember  about  the  x  , y  , z  .  
the speed  , the number of  shots  per second  , is also very  important .  
human  movements are  relatively  dynamics ,  and  the current  30  k  / s  really  not enough  , especially for  gestures .  
steven  bathiche  from our  redmond  lab  created a  touch  sensor  with adjustable  handle  reprieve  from 1 to  100  ms  , while  modern  serial  sensors  closer to  the latest  indicator  ( 60  @-@ 100  ) .  
not everyone understands  how it  affects the  interaction  between man and  machine .  
in  my work  , it would be  very useful  to have  a device that  does not require  touching  and will  have more  shots  in the  second .  
-  does  the number of  cameras  should  be increased  ?  
the  kinect  there are  three cameras  now  , one of which  is actually an  infrared emitter  , and  second  , the recipient  of the signal  .  
the third  is  actually  a regular  sensor  the visible  range .  
it  does not apply  to determine the  object  of depth  .  
potentially ,  a large number of  cameras  could  solve the problem  ...  
or  make it  worse  by increasing  the required  amount of  payments .  
it would be nice  to create  flexible  analogue  kinect  ,  playing with  comes from  the camera  ,  dormitories  and see how  it will help  in  three @-@ dimensional  definition of the position  .  
&quot; as far as  i remember  , microsoft  does not  represent their  glasses  to  the public  , unlike  google .  
don &apos;t you think  it is one of  the most promising  areas  in terms of  everyday use  augmented reality  technology  ?  
&quot; of course  , it is not  very convenient  to walk with  a smartphone  in your  raised their hands  all the time  , but  i think that the  best option  would be a &quot;  transitional  &quot;  augmented reality  , where  you could  shift from  glasses for  smartphones ,  the projection  screen ,  and everywhere  , based on the  cloud  platform .  
points  are very  personal  devices ,  that is  their strength  (  personal belongings  only see  you  )  and ,  at the same time  , their  weakness  is  augmented reality  , based on the  glasses  will not allow  you to work  with virtual  objects  , together  with other people .  
&quot;  let &apos;s imagine  for a moment that  manipulation  of virtual  holographic  objects  in the air  is available  not only to  tony  stark  of the  ironman  , but for the  common man .  
there is one  problem with  this idea  that  critics often  point  : no  tactile  feedback  .  
hands  himself  nothing !  
what answers  your group  to prepare for  this  problem ?  
-  in his  lecture ,  i often say that  augmented reality  -  the seventh  consecutive  attempt  the interaction  between man and  machine .  
i think  the eighth  is likely to be  adding  tactile  sensations .  
at the moment ,  one of the most interesting  tricks  is to use  the second  hand  as a kind of  matrix  image .  
it is great  when registering  pushes  !  
but there are  technologies that  really  aimed to  these &quot;  pictures  in the air  , &quot;  a sense of  tangibility  , for example ,  the intervention of  a number of targeted  ultrasound  beams  to a certain  point where the  finger  is  gives  a sensation  , but  very weak  right now  , as if  someone  blew  on the  web site .  
there are also  watches  bracelets  that affect  nerve  endings  in  his fingers  , who is also  the promising  .  
&quot; you  tried  to trick  the brain  ?  
to make  her  think he  feels  something that  it must  be  feeling  when  he sees  something ?  
&quot;  it is  a good idea ,  and  we have not tried  it  yet .  
it hides  one problem  that  cannot be  solved  so quickly  - how  to make  a man who  is physically  very limited  to believe that  he is going  to  open ,  virtually limitless  space  ;  we are working on  the concept of  treadmills  (  generally  do not like  at clubs  ) ,  moving  platforms ,  and  giant  balloons  .  
so far ,  deceiving  the brain  has  limited  success ,  there is  work  for many years to come  .  
this is  what makes  the work  on the  virtual reality  so  attractive to  researchers  - many  things  in their  beginnings .  
judgment  calls  instead of  culture  &quot;  rosbalt.ru  
&quot;  rosbalt  continues to  project  the st. petersburg  avant @-@ garde  dedicated to  residents who  are ahead  in the  avant @-@ garde  art and culture  .  
it is  the top  @-@ list  already  includes  prominent  figures in  the arts  scene in  st. petersburg ,  whose achievements  to go beyond  the city  , often  admits  to europe  , bypassing  fame  in russia  .  
a new player  in &quot;  rosbalt  &quot; -  a courageous  artist  cyril  miller  .  
the whole  town  knows ,  cyril  miller  , a  bearded  man  dressed  in red  , which  you can see the  russian museum  , or  by the summer  garden ,  or  on the  fashionable  parties and  concerts .  
cyril  miller &apos;s work  always brings  in  the crowds  of people  ,  regardless of  where they  were  .  
cyril  miller  is one of the  purely  st. petersburg  social and  philosophical  storytellers  and the creators  of a new  mythology .  
cyril  miller  is an outstanding  person  of the st. petersburg  avant @-@ garde  in the late 1980s  and early  1990s  .  
in addition , he  is  a city  person who  makes people  smile  on the street and  raises  up  universal  spirit .  
he recently  took  up the  street  organ music  and became  st.  petersburg  man  because he  was  ready for  this complex  role  with all  his  bohemian  life ,  philosophy and  image .  
-  cyril  ,  why did you  walk  around the city  all in  red  , yellow  or  turquoise  ,  for example  ?  
&quot; i  chose the  red  as a designer  is engaged in  appearance and  image .  
in this world ,  red -  a compromise  between the  artist ,  image @-@  maker  and society  .  
although  in society  , all that is  not  gray  causes  aggression and  canvassing  in  bad  shape .  
but my  provocations  aimed at  starting  a conversation  .  
the whole history  of my  provocative actions  is  an invitation  to  debate .  
&quot; when  you  realize that  you have to be  an artist  ?  
&quot;  the exhibition in  the  house of culture  , where  my work  was shown  .  
it became clear to me  that this is  my way  .  
then  a wave of  senior  free ,  informal  artists  went ,  while the  new  , free  artists  like me  don &apos;t  understand .  
i became friends  with artists  new wave  , with  a post @-@  gaza  @-@  nevsky  style  artists  ( &quot;  post @-@  gazonevschina  &quot; )  , which led to  pushkinskaya  10  , and  there was no longer  a wave  .  
i brought  in a theater  , clothes  , music  , all  genres ,  except in  literature .  
&quot; and it &apos;s all  were united  in their  art @-@  clinic  ... -  it was important for me  to find  themselves  at the center of the  culture  of st. petersburg  , where  all  the best  creative forces  must unite  .  
in 1995  i  occupied territories  on pushkin  @-@ 10  , and  although the  repair work  has not yet  begun ,  was  a musical  and creative  club ,  a bohemian  club  house  in st. petersburg  in the czech republic .  
many  were born  here :  nomy  ,  tequila  jazz ,  i remember when  then was  delivered there  with  van gogh  &apos;s ear  project .  
then ,  and his friends  lip  simple  sang songs  ,  wearing tight  leotards  and now  fashionable  composer  igor  vdovin  was with  them .  
when  the band  started playing  live ,  was the  leningrad .  
trakhtenberg  was  leading  many  programs  before the  hali  @-@  ghali  times .  
we  gave them  trakhtenberg  , and  a great  career was  on its way  , but the  basic education  and mentoring  he received  from us .  
the gallery  d  137 ,  griboedov  ,  club -  all this  echo of  art @-@  clinic .  
that &apos;s where  our employees  and left  for regular customers .  
i am a  hero of the  last century  , when  the culture  meant  something  .  
in 2000 ,  was  a poll  in the press ,  for the people  of our city .  
i was  nominated for  artist ,  culminate  came to an end  .  
in  the new  times ,  it is  inconvenient  to work  under the  old rules  . &quot;  i am  a man  of truth  , honesty  and culture  of the last  century .  
nowadays  , it is easy  to become  popular ,  but the  culture and  the popularity of  different .  you can  be  popular  , but  not very  culturally  .  
&quot; your  work is  marked by  its  recognizable  style .  
&quot;  many of my  works  are  hits  ,  with clearly  reflects  the importance  and  the poignancy  of vision  .  
i will  have a  program of the  exhibit  ,  &quot; the russian museum  in the  clowns  . &quot;  
clowns  -  the eternal  category .  
i was  social and  before ,  now  it is  painful  and scary  .  
but all  dilute  the  clowns ,  the tragedy  is removed  .  
i love the  grotesque  , i  бредовых  ideas .  
for example ,  saving  the world  with the help of a  totalitarian  to change clothes  on order  .  
nowadays , people  are judged  by appearance  , not their  internal qualities  .  
who knows  , maybe  you can &apos;t  shake  his hand  , and  need to  spit  in the face .  
but  the lies  will disappear  with the help of a  changing  clothes .  
&quot;  recently  we have seen  you in  the role of the  music  man .  -  cultural  city  should have  such a  character .  
anyone who  fits  the  role  better than i  ?  
-  may be  , commercial  art  can also be  beautiful  ?  
&quot; today  , commercial  art should  be careful  and considerate  , sweet  .  
is the  disintegration of  cultures .  
people used to  gather in  the pack  , czechs  loved  one thing  ,  ordinary people  , something  else .  
now everyone  is divided into  micro  societies ,  it is difficult to be  everyone .  
i &apos;m not  one hundred  dollar  to  please everyone  .  
now you  must think  of who  will you  please .  
now ,  every  cult  hero  has  100  fans .  
&quot; but  a few thousand  come to  stas mihaylov  !  
-  the actors  @-@  outs  to go  to him  , the sexual  @-@  social  work  there .  
but the  300 people  will come  to the  culture  , not  10,000  .  in the end ,  there are less  management ,  money ,  all the  expiring .  
i have  fans ,  the main thing is  not to make  them  so as not to  spoil  what i  earned  .  
in  my youth  ,  i drew  such  art  that one  collector  was  he  hangs  on one  wall  with  falk  and  larionov  .  
i started  with the  paintings  that  people usually  end .  
the concept  often confused  these days  .  
people say  :  the spiritual  culture ,  a culture  of consumption  .  
there is no culture of  consumption ,  it is  &quot;  from another  opera  . &quot;  
i  am a  man  of yesterday &apos;s  culture .  &quot; i  grew up  on the  examples  of artists  who lived  in poor  and died  in poverty  , refused  the money  for the sake of the  painting .  
it &apos;s  a culture  , i &apos;m  for  .  
-  cyril  that saint @-@ petersburg  lacks  ?  
&quot; good  cultural  experts .  
there is  such a thing  :  the official  for  culture .  
but not  everyone can  be involved in the  culture .  
with proper  rulers  was different  .  kings ,  perhaps  not very well  understood the  culture ,  but  they realized  they need  to stick to  the right  experts .  
there are good  consultants  in moscow  right now  .  
here in  st. petersburg ,  there are people who  could  be experts  , but they are  on the sidelines  because  we need  more advanced  specialists  who will  assess correctly  , these  experts and  give  them  .  
judgment  is that  now  thrive .  
even  erart  , but  they &apos;re all different  because they  honestly  say that  we do not accept  all of  modern art  . &quot;  there are some  artists  who  need to find  other museums  for themselves  .  
that the  st. petersburg  mean to you ?  
&quot; st. petersburg  is not a  cultural capital  , moscow  has  much more  culture ,  there is a  bedrock  there .  
it is  difficult for  art  to grow  on our  rocks .  
we must  cultural  bedrock  , but  we now have  more than  readers  and writers  . &quot;  it is wrong .  
in europe  , there are  a lot of  curious  people who  go to  art exhibitions  ,  concerts .  
here ,  this layer  is  a thin  .  
we must  make  the art of  fashion  , as it was  at the beginning  of the last  century .  
the project  is being implemented  with the support  of st. petersburg .  
bear  in space  
the earth  is in  danger .  
global warming  or  difficulties  with a  killer  asteroid  .  
caravans  of spacecraft  with people  on board  to  search for a  replacement  of the planet  .  
to save  humanity ,  the question  is to  promote  our  race  in conditions of  weightlessness  or  the replacement  of the planet  ?  
i think that  the choice  is small .  
there are  only two  real  planets  that can be  investigated  , even  hypothetically  .  
&quot;  venus  and mars  , &quot; says  a senior fellow at the  institute of astronomy  p.k.  shternberg  state (  gaish  )  vladimir  surdin  .  
but  while the  conditions  on mars  ,  more suitable  for life  , venus  has  500  degrees  the temperature  .  
life is possible  only at  high altitude  or  on the  orbit  of venus  ...  in space  .  
the question  of reproduction  in space  began with  flora .  
half a century  ago ,  the experiments were conducted  at plants  .  
four  generations of  peas  grew up  in orbit  the earth  were not  different from  their peers  .  
then  , the  insects  were  withdrawn  into orbit  , small  fruit flies  .  
in 1979 ,  quail eggs  were sent  into space  to see  how  embryos  develop  in  weightlessness  .  
we get  an absolutely normal  chick  .  
but then  the problem  begins .  
&quot; the problem  is that  it is a  chicken  needs to find  support ,  we need  to get back on its  feet and  start moving  , &quot;  explains the  head of the laboratory of  the institute for biomedical  problems (  imbp  )  vladimir  wounds  after  .  
not finding  support ,  the chickens  were  to fall  around the  disorder .  
after  10 hours  , newborn  experienced  full  atrophy  instincts .  
the chicks  not  react to  light and  sound .  
and  the problem  was that  they just  died  after four  days .  
&quot; we  bred  chickens  twice  there ,  then stalled  , because  it is impossible  to work  with them  , &quot; says vladimir  after  the  failure  of an experiment  with  chickens  in space  .  
the last  of the biological  &quot; mini  @-@  ark  with animals  flew  into orbit  16 years  ago .  
in the spring  of 2013  , experiments  will continue  .  
however ,  only  same @-@ sex  creatures  will be  on the  bion  bio @-@  satellite .  
there was  an experiment  on  rats  that were  sent  into space  with the  fetus .  
in principle ,  there was nothing  extraordinary  there .  
&quot; it was  on the  bio @-@  satellites ,  but again ,  it was a unique  experiment  and  such research  should be conducted  , &quot; says vladimir  passes  .  
after landing  , the  space  rats  in infants  .  
but it is hard to  solve the problem  of reproduction  directly into  space .  
it is not  an easy task .  
the animals  simply cannot  follow  their  sexual  instinct  when they are  out of their  usual  environment .  
in principle  , people  , unlike  animals ,  may  .  
homo  sapiens  have  abstract  thinking ,  and  are able  to create  a decent  emotional  background .  
such  experiments  were not  on ethical  grounds .  
but the  women were  to fly  into space  for 50 years  .  
the biggest risk  was for  tereshkova  .  
the most valuable  for mankind  -  the female body  .  
our &quot;  seagull  &quot;  left ,  and no one can  say  whether  it will be  ok  after the flight  into space  .  
whether  it will be able  to give birth to  a child  after this  flight .  
&quot; no one  answered this question  , &quot; says  veteran of  the rocket and space  industry ,  vakhtang  vachnadze  .  
in june  1964  ,  just one year after  the flight  into space  ,  the first woman  in space  , valentina  tereshkova  gave birth to  a daughter .  
the father  of the child ,  faust  nikolaev ,  also  was a  cosmonaut  .  
in 1988 ,  the second  woman  cosmonaut  , svetlana  savitskaya  , who  went  into orbit  twice  and even  worked  in an open  space ,  gave birth to a  son .  
however ,  the risk  remains .  
we have a few  very few  astronauts  who  were in  order and  healthy children  after long  flights  .  
&quot;  moreover ,  it is dangerous  even for  orbital  flights  , &quot; adds  cosmonaut  , hero  of the soviet  union ,  the hero  of russia ,  valery  polyakov .  
and yet ,  humanity  needs to  look for  new ways  in biotechnology  , protection from  radiation ,  creating  artificial  gravity .  
hydro @-@  lab  cfc  -  phase  of preparation for the  flight .  
here  , the  astronauts  practice  skills  in an open  space  in  zero @-@  gravity .  
the water  simulates  weightlessness  .  
if  for adults  , the water  is the  external environment  , although  comfortable  for babies  is a  native  of elements .  
small  amphibians  seem to  confirm  that life  came  to earth  from the  ocean .  
in connection  with the fact that  the infant  spends  about nine  months  as  fluid in  the womb  ;  it is easier  to get used to  the water  after that  .  
in principle ,  it is  logical because  only  two weeks  to go  from birth to  the first  swimming .  
&quot; it &apos;s  very little  time to  forget  something  , &quot; says  children &apos;s  swimming  instructor  marina  aksyonova  .  
in other words ,  if the  newborn  weightlessness  is a  more natural  ,  a woman should  gravity ,  gravity )  .  
abdominal  and  pelvic muscles  usually  quickly  degenerate into  weightlessness  ;  the ability to  push  the embryo  is declining  .  
well ,  let &apos;s say that  childbirth  stimulants  will work  .  
maybe  it will  push  the child  in a special  room .  
&quot; then  what ?  &quot; asks  valery  polyakov  about this  trivial task .  
on the other hand  , the child  also  needs  an artificial  gravity .  
when the body  does not feel  the pull  of the earth  , it is not  a form of  bone  and muscle  system .  
it is impossible  to  dress  a newborn  in orbit  in  a special  costume for  loading  of training  , as  they do  with adults  .  
it will  simply  not what  he wants  to survive .  
&quot; and  this experiment  that  we will go  on  , allowing  the birth  of a child  in a foreign  environment ,  will lead to the  us  , bringing  a disability  , completely  unadapted  man  on earth  , &quot;  predicts  the chairman of the committee  on bioethics  imbp  ran  igor  пестов  .  
at the moment ,  the birth  of children  in space  is  only a  theory .  
but over time ,  it will become  a reality  , when  earthlings  will go  on a  distant  planet  in their  ships ,  and she  will be home to  their children  , who  were born  in space  .
