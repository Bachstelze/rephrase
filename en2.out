 |0-0| republican |1-1| opposition to |3-3| obama &apos;s |5-5| re @-@ election |4-4| strategy |2-2| 
republican |0-0| leaders have |1-1| justified |2-2| their |3-3| policy of |4-4| the need to |5-5| combat |6-7| electoral |8-8| fraud . |9-10| 
however , the |0-0| brennan |1-1| center |2-2| believes |3-3| this myth |4-5| , saying that |6-9| electoral fraud |10-11| is |12-12| rare |13-13| in the united states |14-16| than the number of |17-19| people |20-20| killed |21-21| by lightning |22-22| . |23-23| 
indeed , |0-1| republican |2-2| lawyers |3-3| identified |4-4| only |5-5| 300 |6-6| cases of |7-7| election fraud |8-10| in the united states |11-13| for ten years |14-17| . |18-18| 
one thing is certain |0-1| : |2-2| these new |3-4| provisions that |5-6| would have a negative effect |7-9| on voters |10-11| turn . |12-13| 
in this sense , |0-3| the measures |4-4| will be |5-5| partly |6-6| undermine |7-7| the american |8-8| democratic system |9-10| . |11-11| 
unlike |0-2| canada , |3-4| us states |5-6| are responsible for the |7-8| organization |9-9| of federal |10-10| elections in |11-12| the united states . |13-15| 
it is in this |0-2| spirit |3-3| that most of |4-7| us government |8-9| passed |10-10| new laws |11-12| , |13-13| since 2009 |14-16| register |17-18| or the |19-19| electoral process |20-21| more difficult |22-22| . |23-23| 
this phenomenon |0-1| has gained |2-2| momentum |3-3| after the elections |4-5| in november 2010 |6-9| , which |10-11| saw |12-12| 675 |13-13| new |14-14| members of |15-15| the republican |16-16| added |17-17| in 26 |18-19| states . |20-21| 
as a result , |0-2| 180 |3-3| bills |4-4| limiting |5-5| the exercise of |6-6| the right |7-7| to vote in |8-9| 41 |10-10| states |11-11| were introduced |12-13| in 2011 |14-16| alone . |17-19| 
the new |0-0| election laws |1-3| require |5-5| voters |4-4| to show |6-8| a photo |9-9| id |10-11| and proof of |12-13| us citizenship |14-15| . |16-16| 
in addition , these |0-3| laws also |4-5| reduce the |6-6| early voting |7-8| periods |9-10| to refute |11-11| the right |12-12| to register |13-13| as |14-15| voters |16-16| on election day |17-19| and |20-20| withdraw |21-21| the right to vote |22-23| of citizens |24-24| with |25-25| criminal records |26-26| . |27-27| 
on the eve of |0-0| the 2006 elections |1-3| , |4-4| no us |5-7| state |8-8| requires |9-9| voters |10-10| to show |11-13| a photo |14-14| id |15-16| . |17-17| 
indiana |0-0| became the |1-1| first state |2-3| to impose |4-4| such a requirement . |5-7| 
in 2008 , |0-2| the u.s. supreme court |3-5| upheld the |6-6| constitutionality of the |7-7| indiana |8-8| law . |9-10| 
the republican authorities |0-1| were |2-2| quick |3-3| to spread |4-4| the practice |5-6| to other |7-8| states . |9-10| 
over the last two years |0-3| , they |4-4| have organized |5-5| bills |6-6| in 34 |7-8| states |9-9| get voters |10-13| to show |14-16| a photo |17-17| id |18-19| . |20-20| 
it is important |0-0| to note that |1-3| , unlike in |4-7| quebec , |8-9| american citizens |10-11| do not have |12-13| universal |14-14| id card |15-16| , such as |17-19| health insurance |21-22| card |20-20| . |23-23| 
indeed , |0-3| 11 % |4-5| of american |6-6| citizens , |7-8| i.e. the |9-10| 21 million |11-12| people |13-13| of voting |14-14| age , |15-16| do not have |17-18| a photo |19-19| id card |20-21| issued by the |22-23| authority of |24-25| their |26-26| state . |27-28| 
in addition |0-1| , five |2-3| million new |4-5| voters in |6-7| 2012 , |8-9| do not have |10-11| such |12-12| identification . |13-14| 
and |0-0| it often |1-2| costs |3-3| more than a hundred |4-5| dollars |6-6| to get |7-9| the necessary |10-10| id cards |11-12| . |13-13| 
the new |0-0| restrictions are |1-1| disproportionately |2-2| affect |3-4| young people |5-6| , |7-7| minorities and |8-9| people with |10-11| low incomes |12-13| . |14-14| 
in fact |0-0| , 25 |1-2| % african american , |3-5| 15 |6-6| % of |7-7| those earning |8-11| less than $ |12-13| 35,000 |14-14| ; |15-15| 18 % |16-17| of citizens |18-18| over 65 |19-20| years old |21-21| and 20 |22-23| % |24-24| of voters |25-25| 18 to |26-28| 29 |29-29| years old |30-30| , do not have |31-33| the required |34-34| photo |35-35| id cards |36-38| . |39-39| 
and |0-0| that &apos;s not all |1-4| . |5-5| 
the students |0-0| , voters |1-2| considered |3-3| ballot |4-4| more to |5-6| democratic |7-7| candidates , |8-9| are not allowed |10-11| in several states |12-14| to use |15-15| a photo |16-16| id card |17-18| issued |19-20| their |21-21| institutions . |22-23| 
on the other hand , |0-3| these same |4-5| states |6-6| allow |7-7| fishing or |8-9| hunting |10-10| club members who |11-14| voted |15-15| more |16-16| republicans |17-17| to use the cards |18-21| issued by |22-23| these |24-24| clubs |25-25| when they |26-28| vote |29-29| . |30-30| 
until 2004 , |0-3| no state |4-7| requires |8-8| proof of |9-9| citizenship for |10-11| voting . |12-13| 
arizona |0-0| was the first |1-2| to introduce |3-3| such a requirement . |4-6| 
starting in |0-1| 2011 |2-3| , |4-4| a dozen |5-5| states |6-6| have passed |7-7| laws |8-8| requiring |9-10| voters |11-11| to prove that |12-16| they are |17-17| u.s. |18-18| citizens . |19-20| 
these measures |0-1| are clearly |2-2| intended to limit the |3-5| hispanic |6-6| voters . |7-8| 
however , |0-1| it seems that |2-4| two out of three |5-7| hispanic |8-8| voters |9-9| voted |10-10| democratic party . |11-13| 
moreover , in |0-3| 2011 , |4-5| republican |6-6| legislators passed |7-8| laws |9-9| to cancel |10-11| the registration of voters |12-13| on election day |14-16| in eight |17-18| states . |19-20| 
in addition , they |0-3| limited |4-4| the rights of |5-5| individuals and |6-7| groups , |8-9| to provide assistance |10-11| to voters |12-13| wishing to |14-15| register . |16-17| 
these |0-0| restrictions are |1-1| not without |2-3| consequences . |4-5| 
for example , |0-1| in the |2-2| 2004 |3-4| general election , |5-7| voter registration |8-9| campaigns |10-10| contributed to |11-11| the registration of |12-12| about 10 |13-14| million |15-15| citizens . |16-17| 
however |0-0| , the |1-1| measures taken |2-4| since 2009 |5-7| led to |8-9| 17 % |10-11| decline |12-12| rate |13-13| registering |14-14| new voters |15-16| in 2010 , |17-19| compared with |20-22| 2006 . |23-25| 
in addition , |0-2| republican |3-3| lawmakers |4-4| have enacted laws |5-6| in five |7-8| other states |9-10| to reduce |11-14| the early voting |15-16| . |17-17| 
for example , in |0-2| the general election |3-5| in florida |6-7| , 33 |8-9| % in the early |10-12| voters , |13-13| african @-@ |14-15| americans who |16-18| were |19-19| , |20-20| however , |21-21| only 13 |22-23| % |24-24| of voters |25-25| in the state . |26-28| 
the same |0-1| applies to |2-3| latin americans |4-4| . |5-5| 
these |0-0| are |1-1| only 11 |2-3| % |4-4| of voters |5-5| , but |6-7| 24 % |8-9| of citizens |10-10| who |11-12| voted |13-13| early . |14-15| 
on the other hand , |0-3| 76 % |4-5| of voters |6-6| were |7-7| white |8-8| , |9-9| but these |10-11| were just |12-13| 46 % |14-15| of voters |16-16| early . |17-18| 
of course , |0-1| democratic |2-2| lawmakers |3-3| and |4-4| their supporters |5-6| vigorously opposed |7-8| the adoption |9-9| of laws |10-10| that restrict |11-12| the registration of voters |13-14| . |15-15| 
several |0-0| bills |1-1| that were |2-4| blocked by |5-5| the veto |6-6| by democratic |7-7| governors . |8-9| 
the united states |0-1| attorney general |2-3| intervened |4-4| to suspend |5-5| the most controversial |6-7| laws . |8-9| 
part |2-2| they were able to |0-1| limit the damage . |3-5| 
for example |0-0| , only |1-2| 16 of |3-4| 34 countries |5-6| have adopted |7-7| laws |8-8| requiring |9-10| the presentation |11-11| photo |12-12| id card |13-14| . |15-15| 
however , |0-1| the new rules |2-3| put |4-4| in place |5-6| , |7-7| will certainly |8-9| make it |10-11| more difficult |12-13| to exercise |14-14| the right to vote |15-16| in 2012 . |17-20| 
democratic |0-0| critics |1-1| condemn |2-2| fanatical |3-3| character of the |4-4| laws |5-5| that have been taken |6-9| , and |10-11| they see |12-13| a clear |14-14| goal of the |15-15| impact on the |16-17| 2012 |18-19| results |20-20| in key |21-22| states . |23-24| 
in 2011 , the |0-2| brennan |3-3| center |4-4| report shows |5-6| that the countries that |7-11| were adopted |12-13| these laws |14-15| are |16-16| 171 of the |17-17| 270 |18-18| electoral college |20-20| votes |19-19| needed |21-22| to |23-26| win the presidency . |27-31| 
it is |0-0| too early |1-2| to say |3-5| with certainty that |6-9| these legislative |10-11| changes to the |12-13| electoral system |14-15| will have |16-16| a significant impact on |17-19| the outcome of |20-20| the 2012 presidential election |21-24| . |25-25| 
but |0-0| one thing is clear |1-2| : |3-3| these new |4-5| provisions that |6-7| would have a negative effect |8-10| on the |11-11| move . |12-13| 
in this sense , |0-3| the measures |4-4| will be |5-5| partly |6-6| undermine |7-7| the american |8-8| democratic system |9-10| . |11-11| 
prostate cancer screening |0-2| : |3-3| take the test |4-5| or |6-6| not ? |7-8| 
indeed , |0-1| the dog |2-2| @-@ |3-3| test |4-4| sometimes |5-5| demonstrates the |6-6| erroneous |7-7| results with |8-9| false |10-10| negative |11-11| or even |12-13| false |14-14| positive results |15-16| , which include |17-19| unnecessary |20-20| medical |21-21| intervention . |22-23| 
it is enough |0-0| to make the |1-3| already |4-4| reluctant |5-5| men |6-6| hesitate |7-7| to accept |8-8| screening |9-9| tests |10-11| . |12-12| 
take |0-0| the test |1-1| or not |2-3| ? &quot; |4-4| 
we asked |0-1| two |2-2| experts |3-3| for their |4-5| opinions . |6-7| 
in research |0-1| conducted in the usa |2-5| , there were many |6-8| pollution |9-9| between the |10-10| control group |11-12| , so |13-14| it is difficult to |15-15| interpret the |16-16| data and |17-18| make |19-19| firm |20-20| recommendations . |21-22| 
another study |0-1| , this time for |2-5| a european |6-6| , came |7-8| to the conclusion that |9-12| there is a huge difference |13-15| in |16-16| mortality rates |17-18| among patients |19-20| who |21-22| were screened |23-23| and those who |24-27| were not |28-29| . |30-30| 
the study |0-1| also showed |2-3| , |4-4| with further |5-6| after 12 |7-8| years |9-9| , that it is |10-12| between |13-13| 30 and |14-15| 40 % |16-17| more likely |18-19| for |20-20| metastases |21-21| in the absence of |22-23| screening . |24-25| 
therefore , |0-0| i recommend |1-2| the test |3-3| from 50 |4-5| years , |6-7| or |8-8| 40 , |9-10| if you have a |11-14| direct |15-15| relative |16-16| , who |17-18| was previously |19-20| prostate cancer |21-22| . |23-23| 
african @-@ |0-1| american men |2-3| are also |4-4| more |5-5| at risk |6-7| . |8-8| 
the key |0-0| is to |1-5| make the right choice |6-8| when the |9-10| cancer |11-11| was discovered |12-13| . |14-14| 
there is |0-0| an aggressive |1-1| cancer and |2-3| others which are |4-7| indolent |8-8| . |9-9| 
the patient |0-0| really |1-1| needs to be done |2-4| to understand |5-7| the extent of |8-8| his cancer |10-11| risk |9-9| by offering |12-13| him the |14-14| options , |15-16| not necessarily |17-18| the treatment of |19-19| prostate cancer |20-21| , which are not |22-25| life threatening |27-28| and |29-29| long @-@ term |26-26| , deciding |30-31| instead , in |32-35| such cases |36-37| for active |38-39| monitoring |40-40| of the disease |41-41| . |42-42| 
today , |0-0| many of the men |1-2| , |3-4| which |5-5| was detected |6-7| cancer |8-8| will not |9-10| cure cancer |11-12| , because |13-15| they are not |16-17| aggressive |18-18| and is not a |19-21| threat to |22-23| life . |24-25| 
the active |0-0| monitoring will be |1-3| , |4-4| and if |5-6| the disease |7-7| progresses |8-8| , they will |9-11| be offered |12-12| treatment . |13-14| 
more and more |0-3| , |4-4| the specific |5-5| criteria |6-6| are defined |7-7| in order |8-9| to decide |10-11| who should |12-13| or |14-14| should not |15-16| be treated |17-17| . |18-18| 
therefore , |0-0| i recommend |1-2| to take the |3-3| exam . |4-5| 
but it is important |0-1| to discuss |2-4| with your doctor |5-6| to determine |7-10| whether |11-12| to accept |13-13| it . |14-15| 
in cooperation with the |0-2| société |3-3| internationale |4-4| d |5-5| &apos;urologie |6-6| &#91; |7-7| siu |8-8| &#93; , |9-10| movember |11-11| created a |12-12| tool that allows you to |13-16| evaluate the |17-17| pros and |18-19| cons of |20-20| dog |21-21| @-@ |22-22| test . |23-24|

the disease |1-1| prevention |0-0| 
unfortunately |0-1| , there is no |2-4| miracle |5-5| recipe |6-6| to prevent |7-8| cancer . |9-10| 
despite the |0-1| progress in |2-3| research , |4-5| to adopt |6-6| healthy |7-7| habits of life |8-9| remains |10-10| the best way to |11-12| reduce the risk of |13-14| suffering |15-16| from it . |17-19| 
it is estimated that |0-2| if everyone |3-4| ate well |5-6| and |7-7| has |8-8| enough |9-9| , 30 |10-11| % |12-12| from cancer |13-14| can be |15-15| prevented . |16-17| 
&quot; if |0-1| people are no longer |2-4| smoked |5-5| , |6-6| this figure |7-8| may increase |9-10| by at least 50 |11-14| % |15-15| , &quot; says |16-19| andre |20-20| beaulieu |21-21| , a spokesman for the |22-23| canadian |24-24| cancer society |25-26| . |27-27| 
on the other hand , |0-3| it is estimated that |4-6| about 10 |7-8| % - |9-10| hereditary |11-11| cancer . |12-13| 
some of them |0-2| also |3-3| completely |4-4| inexplicable |5-5| . |6-6| 
for |0-0| the canadian |1-1| cancer society |2-3| , the fight against |4-6| tobacco |7-7| remains a |8-8| priority , |9-10| despite the decline in |11-13| the number of |14-14| smokers |15-15| . |16-16| 
cigarettes |0-0| are associated with |1-2| 85 |3-3| % of |4-4| cases of |5-6| lung cancer . |7-9| 
he is also a |0-2| risk factor |3-4| for |5-5| a number of |6-6| others . |7-8| 
it is |0-0| irreparable damage |1-2| to human health . |3-5| 
&quot; even |0-1| today , |2-2| there are |3-3| 1.5 million |4-5| smokers in |6-7| quebec |8-8| &quot; |9-9| regrets |10-10| the representative |11-11| andre |12-12| beaulieu . |13-14| 
encouraging |0-0| data |1-1| : 10 |2-3| years after |4-5| refraining |6-6| from smoking |7-8| , the risk of |9-10| death |11-11| from cancer |12-13| drops |14-14| by half |15-15| . |16-16| 
the weight |0-0| , |1-1| 
overweight |0-1| and obesity |2-3| also contributes to |4-5| the emergence of |6-6| the disease |7-7| , according to the |8-10| scc |11-11| . |12-12| 
they can |0-1| increase the |2-2| risk of |3-4| breast cancer |5-7| , |8-8| colon |9-9| and |10-10| rectum |11-12| , esophagus |13-14| , |15-15| pancreas |16-17| and |18-18| uterus . |19-20| 
&quot; |0-0| research shows that |1-4| regular |5-5| sessions |6-6| of physical activity |7-8| throughout his |9-12| life , |13-14| protects against |15-16| colon cancer |17-19| is |20-21| also said |22-23| . |24-24| 
the diet |0-0| , |1-1| 
the organization also |0-1| recommends |2-2| to limit |3-3| their |4-4| consumption of |5-5| red meat . |6-8| 
in large quantities |0-2| , |3-3| it increases the |4-5| risk of developing |6-7| colon cancer |8-10| colorado . |11-13| 
similarly |0-1| , as the |2-4| shell of |5-5| meat products |6-7| , and these |8-10| should be avoided . |11-13| 
preservation of |0-0| the meat |1-1| from smoking |2-3| , drying |4-5| or treatment |6-7| can cause |8-9| the formation of |10-10| carcinogens |11-11| . |12-12| 
&quot; they |0-1| can damage |2-3| cells |4-4| in the body |5-6| and |7-7| lead to the development |8-10| of cancer |11-11| , &quot; he explained |12-16| . |17-17| 
the vitamins and |0-1| 
in recent years , |0-2| many scientists |3-4| have studied |5-5| the link between |6-7| vitamin supplements |8-9| and |10-10| cancer . |11-12| 
at the moment , |0-3| however , their |4-5| studies |6-6| are |7-7| inconclusive |8-8| . |9-9| 
research |0-0| on |1-1| vitamin e |2-3| , are |4-5| contradictory |6-6| , |7-7| according to |8-8| the |9-9| company . |10-10| 
in |0-0| one study |1-2| , an increase in the |3-4| risk |5-5| of developing prostate cancer |6-8| , another |9-10| noted |11-11| the increase |12-12| . |13-13| 
also , |0-0| the effect of |1-1| vitamin d |2-3| to |4-4| cancer |5-5| is not |6-7| clear . |8-9| 
in addition |0-1| , mr. |2-3| beaulieu |4-4| emphasizes |5-5| the importance of |6-6| discussing |7-7| their problems |8-9| and family |10-11| history |12-12| with the |13-13| doctor . |14-15| 
&quot; |0-1| screening |2-2| test |3-3| doesn &apos;t give you |4-6| cancer |7-7| . &quot; |8-9| 
the |0-0| higgs |2-2| ??????? |1-1| disclosed |3-3| 
the announcement of the |0-1| discovery of the |3-3| probable |2-2| higgs |5-5| ??????? |4-4| created |6-6| a furore |7-8| last summer |9-10| , and |11-12| not without reason |13-15| . |16-16| 
indeed , |0-1| it is believed that |2-4| it is the |5-5| higgs |6-6| is part of the |7-8| mechanism |9-9| , which |10-11| is responsible for |12-13| all the |15-15| mass |14-14| in the universe |16-17| , not |18-19| less . |20-21| 
it is also |0-1| the last |2-2| particle |3-4| whose existence |5-6| is |7-7| predicted by the |8-8| standard model |9-10| is our |11-12| better or |13-14| worse |15-15| &quot; less |16-17| &quot; |18-18| explanation |19-19| of nature |20-20| and |21-21| the behavior |22-22| of matter |23-23| - but |24-25| who |26-27| have not yet been |28-30| observed |31-31| empirically |32-32| . |33-33| 
but for |0-1| physicists |2-2| , this is still |3-5| not completely |6-7| sure that |8-12| it really is the |13-15| higgs |16-16| . |17-17| 
we know |0-2| without a |3-3| shadow of |4-4| a doubt |5-5| that |6-7| this is a |8-9| genuine |10-10| particles , |11-12| and |13-13| strongly |14-14| resembles |15-15| ??????? |17-17| predicted by the |16-16| standard model |19-20| higgs |18-18| . |21-21| 
in addition , |0-2| new data |3-4| released |5-5| this week |6-8| on the |9-10| physics |11-11| of the congress |12-12| in kyoto |13-14| , seems to |15-17| confirm this |18-19| , but |20-21| there are still |22-23| not enough |24-24| data to |25-27| be absolutely sure |28-30| . |31-31| 
but |0-0| let &apos;s |1-1| suppose that |2-4| it really is the |5-7| higgs |8-8| , because the |9-10| chances of being |11-12| wrongly |13-13| seem |14-14| insignificant |15-15| and see |16-19| what it is . |20-23| 
in our world , |0-3| there is |4-4| the |5-5| inevitable |6-6| law that |7-9| stipulates |10-10| that the |11-12| two things |13-14| can not |15-16| meet |17-17| at the |18-18| same place |19-22| at the same time |23-26| . |27-27| 
there is no way |0-2| to break |3-3| this rule |4-5| - and |6-7| don &apos;t try |8-9| too |10-10| hard |11-11| , |12-12| it &apos;s crazy |13-16| . |17-17| 
however , |0-1| although the |2-2| particle physics |3-4| is a very |5-6| strange |7-7| world , |8-9| it turns out that |10-12| she also |13-14| has the right to |15-16| the same |17-18| kind of |19-19| : |20-20| pauli |21-21| exclusion |22-22| principle , |23-24| which says |25-26| that the |27-28| two |29-29| particles |30-30| can &apos;t |31-32| occupy the |33-33| same |34-35| place |36-37| at the same time |38-41| , if |42-43| they are in |44-46| the same |47-48| &quot; |49-49| quantum |50-50| state |51-51| &quot; is a |52-54| &quot; |55-55| state &quot; |56-57| consisting |58-59| of about |60-60| some |61-61| of their |62-62| characteristics . |63-64| 
as a result , |0-3| physicists |4-4| classify |5-5| particles |6-6| into two |7-8| categories . |9-10| 
in one corner |0-2| we have |3-4| good |5-5| citizens |6-6| called |7-7| fermions |8-8| , who |9-10| wisely |11-11| obey |12-12| pauli |13-13| principle . |14-15| 
while the |0-3| others |4-5| are |6-6| bosons |7-7| , |8-8| a |9-9| group of |10-10| anarchists |11-11| who |12-13| respect |14-14| nothing - |15-16| at least , |17-20| not |21-21| this principle |22-23| , which means that |24-28| they really |29-30| can be found in the |31-34| same place |35-39| at the same time . |40-41| 
these |0-0| bosons |1-1| then |2-2| divided into |3-4| two groups |5-6| , according to the |7-9| berkeley |10-10| labs |11-11| particle |12-12| adventure |13-13| site |14-14| ( absolutely |15-16| extraordinary |17-17| , |18-18| by the way |19-19| ) |20-20| : a |21-21| @-@ |22-22| b mesons |23-23| , which |24-25| we will not |26-28| discuss |29-29| here , |30-31| and &quot; |32-33| the forces of |34-34| particles |35-35| , &quot; |36-36| by which |37-40| the great |41-41| forces |42-42| of nature |43-43| , |44-44| and |46-46| apply |45-45| the |47-48| higgs |50-50| ??????? |49-49| may be |51-52| somehow |53-56| linked . |57-60| 
these |0-0| bosons |1-1| , |2-2| it should be stressed |3-4| here , |5-6| not all |7-8| such |9-9| exotic |10-10| errors , |11-12| as you |13-14| think . |15-16| 
indeed , |0-3| if you |4-5| can read |6-7| this article |8-9| , |10-10| it is thanks to |11-12| an extremely |13-13| banal |14-14| higgs |15-15| : |16-16| photon , |17-18| or &quot; |19-20| light |21-21| particles |22-22| , &quot; |23-24| which is |25-26| &quot; the messenger |27-28| &quot; |29-29| electromagnetic |30-30| force . |31-32| 
when |0-0| , in |1-2| fact , |3-4| a particle |5-6| with |7-7| an electric |8-8| charge |9-9| accelerates |10-10| or |11-11| changing direction |12-13| , it &apos;s &quot; |14-16| offended |17-17| &quot; |18-18| electromagnetic field |19-20| in this particular |21-23| place , |24-25| rather |26-27| like a |28-29| pebble |30-30| thrown in |31-32| a pond |33-33| . |34-34| 
this &quot; |0-1| unrest |2-2| &quot; produces |3-4| electromagnetic |5-5| waves ( |6-7| light , |8-9| infrared |10-10| , |11-11| ultraviolet |12-12| , etc . |13-14| ) , |15-16| and |17-17| this wave |18-19| is |20-21| nothing less than a |22-26| photon |27-27| - |28-28| and thus |29-33| one of |34-35| the &quot; |36-36| forces of |37-37| bosons |38-38| carrier |39-39| . &quot; |40-41| 
the more |0-0| stable |1-1| field |2-2| 
the same |0-2| applies to |3-5| ??????? |6-6| higgs |7-7| , |8-8| with the difference |9-11| that this is |12-14| another area |15-17| , |18-18| the |19-19| field , which |20-22| should be &quot; |23-25| disturbed |26-26| &quot; for the |27-28| higgs |29-29| to appear |30-30| . |31-31| 
now |0-0| it is the |1-1| higgs |2-2| field |3-3| is much |4-4| , much |5-6| more stable |7-8| than the |9-10| electromagnetic field |11-12| ; |13-13| to |14-14| the case |15-15| , it is necessary |16-17| to achieve |18-18| a very , very |19-21| high level of |22-23| energy , |24-25| more closely resembles |26-27| the frozen |28-28| pond |29-29| , who |30-31| will need |32-33| a very big |34-35| rock |36-37| wrinkles |38-38| surface . |39-40| 
that is why |0-1| the huge |2-2| particle accelerator at cern |3-7| - as one large |8-11| hadron collider |12-13| - the |14-14| ring with |15-16| 27km |17-17| circumference |18-18| ! |19-19| - it is necessary |20-21| to achieve |22-24| this level |25-26| of energy |27-27| . |28-28| 
the analogy |0-0| with |1-1| electromagnetic field |2-3| again |4-4| useful |5-5| for explaining |6-7| the relationship between |8-9| the |10-10| and |11-11| mass . |12-13| 
in fact , |0-2| not all |3-4| particles , |5-6| or all |7-8| the materials |9-10| to interact with |11-12| electromagnetic field |13-14| . |15-15| 
some , |0-1| such as |2-3| magnets |4-4| , |5-5| do it |6-7| , but |8-9| others do not |10-11| - |12-12| a piece of |13-13| paper , |14-15| for example , |16-17| never |18-19| will |20-20| stick to the |21-21| refrigerator . |22-23| 
and |0-0| in addition |1-2| , not all the |3-5| particles |6-6| interact |7-7| with the |8-8| higgs |9-9| field |10-10| : those |11-12| who have no |13-16| mass , |17-18| while others |19-23| ( |24-24| such as |25-26| the photon |27-27| ) does not |28-29| . |30-30| 
now |0-0| that all |1-3| this research |4-5| &quot; may |6-7| bring |8-8| &quot; ? |9-10| &quot; asks |11-12| ms |13-13| plamondon |14-14| . |15-15| 
for |0-0| science , |1-2| it serves |3-4| to verify |5-6| the validity of the |7-7| standard model |8-9| ( |10-10| cm ) |11-12| , and |13-14| also allows |15-16| doctors |17-17| consider any |18-19| discrepancies |20-20| between the |21-21| observations |22-22| and forecasts |23-24| . |25-27| 
the number of people |0-2| in addition , |3-5| strongly |6-6| hope that |7-9| some |10-10| will be found |11-12| , because |13-15| the slightest |16-16| difference could |17-18| open the |19-19| door for |20-21| a &quot; new |22-23| physics |24-24| &quot; and |25-26| plug |27-27| some |28-28| holes in the |29-30| model . |31-32| 
this , |0-1| it must be said |2-3| , still |4-6| has a |7-7| huge |8-8| flaws |9-9| , offering |10-11| no explanation |12-13| of gravity |14-14| ( oops |15-16| ! ) |17-18| or |19-19| dark matter |20-21| , which |22-23| is about |24-25| 80 % |26-27| of matter |28-28| in the universe |29-30| ( |31-31| re @-@ |32-32| oops ! |33-34| ) . |35-36| 
but for now , |0-3| there is no such |4-5| discrepancies |6-6| were found |7-8| at |9-9| cern |10-10| . |11-11| 
the consequences |0-0| , |1-1| 
the consequences of |0-0| this study |1-2| in everyday |3-4| life of the man |5-6| on the street |7-8| - |9-9| it is hard |10-10| to predict , |11-12| but it would be |13-15| a mistake |16-16| to assume that |17-19| they |20-20| will not |21-22| . |23-23| 
remember : |0-1| in the |2-3| early |4-4| 1960s |5-7| , the |8-8| pioneers |9-9| of laser |10-10| at |11-11| bell laboratories |12-13| did not suspect |14-15| the revolution that |16-18| could be caused by |19-21| their |22-22| work . |23-24| 
they |0-0| suspect |1-1| the scientific |2-2| applications , |3-4| but nothing |5-6| like |7-8| the rest |9-10| . |11-11| 
indeed , |0-3| the late |4-4| willard |5-5| boyle |6-6| , a |7-7| physicist |8-8| who |9-10| worked at |11-12| bell labs |13-14| , where the |15-16| laser |17-17| was invented |18-19| in 1960 , |20-23| and who |24-25| he developed |26-27| the first |28-28| permanent |29-29| laser |30-30| ( first |31-32| were |33-33| ??????? |34-34| ) |35-35| in 1962 |36-39| - told |40-41| us that |42-44| initially |45-45| laser |46-46| was |47-48| seen as |49-50| &quot; laboratory |51-52| gadget |53-53| . &quot; |54-55| 
imagine |0-1| . ... |2-2| 
and |0-0| then |1-1| , applications |2-3| may also |4-5| come from |6-7| all the devices |8-9| that surrounds the |10-12| research . |13-14| 
for example , |0-1| the same |2-3| willard |4-4| boyle |5-5| has developed |6-6| a small |7-7| sensor |8-8| light |9-9| in 1969 , |10-13| during |14-15| his work |16-17| in optics |18-19| . |20-20| 
this sensor |0-1| , although |2-3| it wasn &apos;t |4-7| the original intent |8-9| , now |10-11| serves as the |12-14| &quot; |15-15| eye |16-16| &quot; to |17-19| all |20-20| digital cameras |21-22| worldwide , |23-26| and earned |27-28| him |29-29| the nobel prize |30-31| in physics |32-33| in 2009 . |34-37| 
of course , this |0-2| does not mean that |3-6| the activities of |7-7| the lhc |8-8| will |9-9| transform |10-10| our lives |11-12| , but |13-14| it does mean that |15-18| , actually , |19-21| you never know |22-25| ... |26-26| 
palliative care |0-1| is the best way |2-4| to die |5-5| ... &#124; |6-7| not |8-8| 
with his death |0-2| with dignity |3-4| commission , |5-6| quebec |7-7| recently |8-8| discussed the |9-9| delicate |10-10| end of |11-11| life . |12-13| 
the debate |0-0| is |1-1| due to |2-2| resume |3-3| shortly after |4-8| the bill |9-9| is preparing |10-10| . |11-11| 
however , |0-0| in this |1-2| vital |3-4| area , |5-6| much remains to be |7-9| done . |10-11| 
not |0-0| tried to |1-1| look more |2-3| closely |4-4| . |5-5| 
just a few |0-1| weeks ago , |2-3| mr l. |4-7| lived alone |8-9| in his |10-11| apartment |12-12| montérégie |13-13| . |14-14| 
the |0-0| festering |1-1| prostate cancer |2-3| allowed |4-4| him a |5-5| two @-@ year |6-6| reprieve |7-7| . |8-8| 
&quot; they gave me |0-3| five years |4-5| to live |6-6| , i |7-8| reached |9-10| seven |11-11| , &quot; he says |12-16| , |17-17| with mixed |18-19| emotions , |20-21| lying |22-22| in bed |23-24| on the |25-25| victor |26-26| @-@ |27-27| gadbois |28-28| palliative care |29-30| home in |31-32| beloeil |33-33| , where |34-35| he arrived at the |36-38| previous day . |39-41| 
&quot; but |0-1| it is another |2-4| shock |5-5| , you |6-7| can never be |8-11| prepared for |12-13| it |14-14| , &quot; he added |15-18| . |19-19| 
the disease |0-0| does its job |1-3| : huge |4-5| weakness , |6-7| which |8-8| prevents him |9-10| to go to |11-11| the bathroom |12-13| alone , |14-16| and even |17-18| there |19-19| alone . |20-22| 
sitting in front of |0-1| lunch |3-3| gatherings |2-2| , he |4-5| agrees that |6-8| they helped |9-10| to eat |11-11| , resigned |12-15| . |16-16| 
the courageous |0-0| , |1-1| he even |2-3| manages to |4-4| smile |5-5| , talks |6-7| with strangers |8-9| bustling |10-10| around him |11-12| , bringing |13-14| him medication |15-16| , offering |17-18| him |19-19| a bath . |20-21| 
the courage |0-0| of ordinary mortals |1-2| . |3-3| 
&quot; what |0-3| i want |4-5| most |6-6| can |7-7| cure my |8-9| diarrhea , |10-11| it is |12-12| humiliating |13-13| , &quot; |14-16| he admitted . |17-19| 
a few hours |0-1| later , |2-3| the team |4-4| found a |5-5| cure for |6-7| this disease . |8-10| 
&quot; |0-0| in our lives , |1-4| we learn that the |5-8| man |9-9| pisses |10-10| standing |11-11| , &quot; says |12-15| pierre |16-16| brodeur |17-17| , |18-18| a psychologist |19-19| victor |20-20| @-@ |21-21| gadbois |22-22| home . |23-24| 
in |0-0| his return |1-1| to the scene |2-3| of the child , |4-5| for some people |6-8| , |9-9| is unacceptable |10-11| humiliation . |12-13| 
&quot; it depends on |0-3| the ability |4-4| of a person |5-5| to &quot; take |6-7| setback |8-8| , he said . |9-12| 
because |0-1| , in the opinion |2-4| of many people |5-6| working in |7-9| palliative care |10-11| , great |12-13| moments |14-14| occur |15-15| in the heart of |16-18| such a |19-19| setback |20-20| . |21-21|

the lack of |0-0| access to |1-2| palliative care |3-4| 
it is said that |0-2| 77 |3-3| % of |4-4| canadians |5-5| simply do not have |6-7| access to |8-9| palliative care |10-11| , which |12-13| is |14-15| designed to |16-17| ease the pain |18-19| when |20-21| the patient |22-22| has entered the |23-24| final stage |25-26| of life , |27-28| whether at home , |29-32| at the hospital |33-34| or at |35-36| home . |37-38| 
and a number of |0-2| organizations |3-3| , such as the |4-6| victor |7-7| @-@ |8-8| gadbois |9-9| home and |10-11| palliative care |12-13| society in |14-15| the greater |16-16| montreal |17-18| specialize |19-19| more or less |20-22| exclusively |23-23| in medical |24-25| services for |26-27| cancer patients |28-29| . |30-30| 
this is the |0-1| big |2-2| gap in |3-4| quebec |5-5| health , |6-7| which has made |8-9| a series of |10-10| palliative care |11-12| doctors |13-13| are afraid |14-14| to adopt |15-15| a law on |16-17| euthanasia and |18-19| assisted |20-20| suicide |21-21| . |22-22| 
since october |0-1| , the manifesto |2-3| signed by |4-5| palliative care |6-7| luminaries |8-8| , including |9-10| dr. |11-11| balfour |12-12| grief and |13-14| dr. |15-15| bernard |16-16| lapointe |17-17| , |18-18| began to |19-19| circulate |20-20| to demonstrate |21-23| their |24-24| opposition to |25-26| such an |27-27| initiative . |28-29| 
according to dr |0-2| christian |3-3| martel |4-4| , |5-5| quebec |6-6| health system |7-8| is not |9-11| effective enough to |12-15| ensure |16-16| that everyone will |17-20| have the right to |21-23| quality |24-24| palliative care |25-26| before |27-30| it is |31-31| taken |32-32| to move to |33-34| euthanasia . |35-36| 
recently |0-0| , she says , |1-4| i saw |5-6| the patient |7-7| to spend |8-8| 14 days |9-10| in emergency |11-12| situations , |13-14| in |15-15| great |16-16| pain , |17-18| without any |19-22| do |23-23| to alleviate its |24-27| suffering . |28-29| 
i |0-0| am afraid |1-1| that the |2-3| patients |4-4| ask |5-5| to die |6-6| because they |7-10| do not receive |11-12| proper care |13-14| . |15-15| 
and |0-0| at the same time |1-4| , some |5-6| oncologists |7-7| tirelessly |8-8| on |9-9| their patients |10-11| until |12-12| the last day |13-14| , despite |15-17| the worst |18-19| predictions |20-20| . |21-21| 
hélène |0-0| richard |1-1| survival |2-2| hopes |3-3| have already been |4-5| minimal |6-6| , when |7-8| she |9-9| ended |10-10| her |11-11| grueling |12-12| chemotherapy . |13-14| 
when i |0-1| announced |2-2| my |3-3| ???????? |4-4| that i was |5-8| stopping the treatment |9-10| , |11-11| she told me |12-14| she |15-15| regretted |16-17| that i already |18-21| have abandoned |22-23| the struggle |24-24| , &quot; she said |25-28| . |29-29| 
however , |0-1| she told |2-3| me that i |4-7| was finished |8-9| . |10-10| 
neither the |0-0| almighty |1-1| care |2-2| 
dr. |0-0| martel |1-1| thinks that |2-4| 90 |5-5| % of patients |6-7| are asked |8-8| to die |9-11| thank |12-12| nurses |13-13| for |14-14| not |15-15| acceding |16-17| to their |18-18| request , |19-19| after they |20-24| were released |25-26| from |27-27| their pain |28-29| on |30-30| palliative care |31-32| team . |33-34| 
but |0-0| i must say that |1-4| palliative care |5-6| is not |7-9| all @-@ powerful |10-10| in the treatment of |11-12| pain . |13-14| 
according to |0-1| elsie |2-2| monereau |3-3| , |4-4| palliative care |5-6| director of |7-7| the |8-8| palliative care |9-10| society |11-11| in montreal |12-13| , patients |14-15| are resistant to |16-17| treatment |18-18| against the |19-19| pain |20-20| at 8 |21-22| % of cases . |23-25| 
at the very end |0-2| of life |3-3| , doctors |4-5| then |6-6| often |7-7| resort to |8-9| palliative |10-10| sedation and |11-11| that the |12-13| equivalent to |14-15| the patient |16-16| to sleep |17-17| until death |18-19| or |20-21| sporadically |22-22| or |23-23| forever . |24-25| 
we can no longer |0-3| pretend |4-5| that |6-7| do not |8-8| understand |9-9| this part of |10-11| their suffering |12-13| . |14-14| 
over time |0-1| , more and more |2-3| unrelieved |4-4| the patient |5-5| will be able to |6-8| carry out |9-9| such |10-10| palliative |11-11| sedation |12-12| . |13-13| 
patients who |0-2| are not |3-4| released |5-5| always say |6-7| the same thing |8-11| : &quot; |12-13| i want to die |14-16| . &quot; |17-18| 
but this does not |0-2| necessarily mean |3-4| &quot; i |5-6| want you to |7-10| euthanise |11-11| me , &quot; |12-14| which means |15-16| &quot; i want to |17-19| be released |20-21| . &quot; |22-23|

as |0-0| you read |1-2| this progress |3-4| ? |5-5| 
this can |0-1| be explained |2-3| the individual |4-4| consciousness , |5-6| but also |7-8| a new |9-9| dimension of |10-10| paris st germain |11-11| . |12-12| 
some of the |0-0| great players |1-2| arrived . |3-4| 
every day i |0-2| &apos;m making |3-3| progress |4-4| along with them |5-7| . |8-8| 
technical staff |0-1| also |2-2| brought me |3-4| a lot . |5-6| 
day by day |0-2| , all of these |3-5| things |6-7| will help me |8-9| to raise |10-10| their level |11-12| of play |13-13| . |14-14| 
and , |0-1| in a |2-2| match , |3-4| it &apos;s |5-5| easier . |6-7| 
all that |0-2| is moving |3-3| very quickly |4-5| in football |6-7| . |8-8| 
but i don &apos;t |0-2| get |3-3| . |4-4| 
my |0-0| debut in |1-2| clairefontaine |3-3| inf |4-4| pre @-@ |5-5| training center |6-7| to |8-9| my |10-10| transfer to |11-12| saint @-@ |13-14| etienne |15-15| , |16-16| i always |17-18| moved |19-19| step by step . |20-23| 
so you |0-2| benefit from |3-4| competition , |5-6| ????????????? |7-7| carlo ancelotti |8-9| . ... |10-10| 
this summer , the |0-1| new recruits |2-2| are accustomed to |3-3| playing |4-4| matches |5-5| at a high level |6-8| . |9-9| 
they also |0-1| know |2-2| that every training session |3-6| is crucial . |7-10| 
what makes |0-1| a player |2-2| as |3-4| i want to |5-6| face up |7-8| and give |9-10| my best |11-12| . |13-13| 
on the other hand , |0-3| carlo ancelotti |4-5| gives me |6-7| a lot of |8-8| as |9-10| my |11-11| position . |12-13| 
he |0-0| supported by |1-2| deputies , |3-4| as |5-5| claude |6-6| makelele |7-7| , |8-8| who played |9-10| in the same |11-13| position |14-15| as me . |16-18| 
ancelotti |1-1| is the |0-0| man for the job |2-4| ? |5-5| 
certainly , |0-1| . |2-2| 
ancelotti |0-0| inspire respect |1-2| among all the |3-4| experts . |5-6| 
today , |0-0| he has no |1-3| equal |4-4| in |5-5| ligue |6-6| 1 |7-7| , and he is |8-10| one of the best |11-13| coaches |14-14| in europe |15-16| . |17-17| 
he has |0-1| a lot of |2-2| experience and |3-4| won many titles |5-7| with the |8-8| top |9-10| clubs . |11-12| 
he worked |0-1| with great |2-3| players |4-4| . &quot; |5-5| 
i |0-0| think he |1-4| will bring |5-5| more titles |6-7| in |8-8| paris . |9-10| 
in january |0-1| , |2-2| i had |3-4| promising |5-5| discussions |6-6| with him |7-8| . &quot; |9-9| 
i was |0-1| just back |2-3| from a |4-4| series of |5-5| injuries . |6-7| 
the confidence that |0-4| he |5-5| gives me |6-7| also explains |8-9| my |10-10| performance |11-11| . |12-12| 
how much |0-0| value |1-1| you |2-2| attach |3-3| to the |4-4| first part |5-6| of the season |7-7| for |8-8| paris st germain |9-9| ? |10-10| 
in |0-0| ligue |1-1| 1 |2-2| , lyon |3-4| caught up with |5-5| us |6-6| at the top . |7-10| 
but we |0-1| are waiting |2-2| on the sidelines |3-4| . |5-5| 
one of our main |0-3| tasks - |4-5| champions league |6-7| : we |8-9| qualified |10-10| for the last |11-12| 16 |13-13| in the right direction |14-16| . |17-17| 
what is the purpose |0-1| of the club |2-2| in this |3-4| competition |5-5| ? |6-6| 
we will try |0-1| to get |2-3| as much as possible . |4-8| 
from now on |0-0| , everything |1-2| can happen |3-4| . |5-5| 
but we |0-1| have to |2-2| say something |3-6| against |7-8| some very |9-10| good |11-11| european |12-12| teams . |13-14| 
first of all , |0-2| we want |3-4| to finish |5-5| top |6-6| in our |7-8| pool |9-9| , ahead |10-11| of porto |12-12| , |13-13| have |14-14| home |15-15| advantage in |16-17| the last |18-18| 16 |19-19| matches . |20-21| 
psg |0-0| may become a |1-2| top |3-4| european club |5-6| in the short term |7-9| ? |10-10| 
already has a |0-1| budget |2-2| ... |3-3| 
to become a top |0-3| european |4-4| club |5-5| , paris |6-7| need to |8-8| win |9-9| titles |10-10| and stay |11-12| with the passage of |13-14| time . |15-16| 
today , |0-1| it is not so |2-4| . |5-5| 
financially , |0-1| paris st germain |2-2| have |3-3| the means |4-4| to make it happen . |5-9| 
in |0-0| ligue |1-1| 1 |2-2| without winning |3-5| a title |6-6| , like |7-9| last season |10-12| , |13-13| would be a big |14-15| failure ? |16-17| 
certainly |0-0| , it will be |1-3| a big |4-4| disappointment . |5-6| 
this year , we |0-3| really |4-4| wants to |5-5| win |6-6| the championship |7-7| . |8-8| 
we |0-0| were not |1-2| far from |3-3| last season . |4-7| 
in may , |0-1| it was |2-2| a big disappointment |3-4| because we |5-8| were |9-9| good enough |10-11| to finish |12-12| first . |13-14| 
it was |0-1| a stunning |2-2| season . |3-4| 
we finished |0-1| with |2-2| 79 |3-3| points . |4-5| 
as a rule , |0-2| 79 |3-3| points |4-4| is |5-5| good enough to |6-9| be |10-10| top |11-11| . ... |12-12| 
but another |0-1| team , |2-3| montpellier |4-4| , were |5-6| even more |7-8| fantastic |9-9| season . |10-11| 
&quot; i |0-0| think this |1-4| year . |5-6| 
even if the |0-1| big teams |2-3| , for example , |4-6| marseille |7-7| , |8-8| lyon |9-9| , bordeaux |10-11| are fighting for |12-13| the title |14-14| , i think |15-18| we have the |19-21| weapons |22-22| to win . |23-26| 
how do you think |0-2| that the media |3-5| expect too |6-7| much |8-8| paris st germain |9-9| ? |10-10| 
it &apos;s normal |0-1| for them |2-3| to expect |4-4| that many |5-7| of us |8-9| , given that |10-13| has invested |14-14| and |15-15| the players |16-16| we have . |17-20| 
we fully |0-1| accept |2-2| it . |3-4| 
after |0-3| we won |4-5| 4 |6-6| @-@ 0 |7-8| at home |9-9| against |10-11| troyes |12-12| , and |13-14| they still |15-17| have found |18-18| things |19-19| to blame |20-20| us |21-21| , it is certainly |22-26| a bit frustrating |27-28| . |29-29| 
you wonder |0-1| that |2-3| more and more people |4-6| expect . |7-8| 
you &apos;re |0-0| never |1-2| going to |3-3| win |4-4| 4 |5-5| @-@ 0 |6-7| every weekend |8-9| . |10-10| 
we are not |0-1| &quot; |2-2| barcelona |3-3| ! &quot; |4-5| 
we &apos;re trying |0-1| to implement |2-2| the game |3-3| project . |4-5| 
it takes time to |0-3| build a |4-4| team . |5-6| 
the champions |1-1| league |0-0| proved that |2-4| we could |5-7| hold their |8-9| own . |10-11| 
look at |0-1| manchester city |2-5| , who |6-7| for the past |8-9| two seasons |10-11| , |12-12| failed to |13-14| qualify |15-15| for the last |16-17| 16 years |18-19| , despite |20-22| also |23-23| having spent |24-24| huge sums |25-26| . |27-27| 
based on the |0-1| amount |2-2| invested |3-3| , you must be |4-7| 15 |8-8| points |9-9| ahead |10-10| on winter |11-12| break |13-13| ! |14-14| 
it would be |0-1| to ignore |2-2| our |3-3| opponents and |4-5| the french |6-6| championship . |7-8| 
lyon |0-0| , marseille |1-2| , who |3-4| did not have |5-6| last season |7-9| , |10-10| were &quot; |11-12| shock &quot; |13-14| to the new |15-16| paris st germain |17-17| . |18-18| 
this shows |0-1| that the |2-3| ligue 1 |4-5| is |6-7| interesting . |8-9| 
i hope that |0-3| in may , |4-5| we will be able |6-7| to smile |8-8| that |9-12| , |13-13| despite all the difficulties |14-17| , we |18-19| finally |20-22| did it |23-24| . |25-25| 
paris st germain |0-0| seem |1-1| totally dependent on |2-4| the exploits of |5-5| zlatan ibrahimovic |6-7| . |8-8| 
so much so that |0-2| people say |3-4| that there is a |5-7| &quot; |8-8| zlatan |9-9| dependence |10-10| . &quot; |11-12| 
this means that |0-3| ibrahimovic |4-4| is very |5-5| successful and |6-7| scores |8-8| a lot of |9-9| goals . |10-11| 
this is why |0-1| he came |2-3| , and |4-5| he proves |6-7| that he is |8-10| the star of |11-11| ligue 1 |12-13| . |14-14| 
he demonstrated |0-1| everywhere |2-2| he went |3-4| , that |5-6| he was a great |7-9| player |10-10| , world |11-12| star . |13-14| 
within the group |0-1| , |2-2| we respect |3-4| the person |5-5| and |6-6| a player |7-7| . |8-8| 
and |0-1| he respects |2-3| the people |4-4| he has |5-6| around him |7-8| . |9-9| 
what he |0-3| did it |4-5| for real . |6-9| 
it |0-0| encourages |1-1| others |2-2| to raise the level |3-6| of the game |7-7| . |8-8| 
thiago |0-0| silva |1-1| , who |2-3| is one of the best |4-7| defenders in the world |8-10| , |11-11| also helps |12-13| the rest |14-15| of progress |16-16| . |17-17| 
how did you get |0-2| on the euro |3-4| @-@ 2012 |5-6| with france |7-8| team |9-9| ? |10-10| 
it is |0-0| disappointment . |1-2| 
i really |0-1| wanted to |2-2| play |3-3| in this |4-5| euro . |6-7| 
unfortunately , |0-2| my injury |3-4| prevented |5-5| me |6-6| from any |7-8| playing time |9-10| . |11-11| 
i &apos;ve seen |0-1| some things |2-4| there and |5-6| came out |7-7| stronger . |8-9| 
today , |0-1| i play |2-3| well in the |4-5| qualifying |6-6| matches . |7-8| 
this is what |0-3| i was |4-5| hoping |6-7| for |8-8| with my |9-10| baptism |11-11| with the |12-13| blues |14-14| . |15-15| 
i learned |0-1| the lessons |2-2| from what |3-6| happened |7-7| in ukraine , and |8-11| now i |12-13| owe |14-14| it to |15-16| myself |17-17| to have |18-18| exemplary behavior |19-20| . |21-21| 
what do you think about |0-3| didier |4-4| deschamps |5-5| the first few |6-7| months |8-8| in charge of the |9-11| blues |12-12| ? |13-13| 
he |0-0| the results , |1-2| he wanted |3-4| . |5-5| 
we also |0-1| placed |2-2| in the world |3-4| qualifying |5-5| group . |6-7| 
the coach |0-0| is a |1-1| tough |2-2| , close to the |3-5| players , |6-7| and inspire them |8-10| to win . |11-12| 
as |0-0| laurent |1-1| blanc |2-2| was . |3-4| 
but i |0-1| don &apos;t want to |2-3| make any |4-5| comparisons |6-6| . |7-7| 
blanc |0-0| had achieved |1-1| its goal |2-3| , |4-4| when we |5-6| qualified |7-7| for the |8-8| euro . |9-10| 
i hope that |0-3| didier |4-4| deschamps |5-5| will take |6-6| the blues in |7-8| brazil . |9-10| 
good |0-0| draw |1-1| ( 1 |2-3| @-@ 1 |4-5| ) |6-6| broke |7-7| in spain |8-9| , |10-10| on october 16 |11-12| , constitute |13-15| grounds for |16-16| the match |17-17| ? |18-18| 
this match |0-1| has given us |2-3| confidence . |4-5| 
all |0-0| fought for |1-2| each . |3-4| 
before |0-1| the shock |2-2| in spain |3-4| , i have never |5-8| experienced |9-9| such a |10-10| match in |11-12| my career |13-14| . |15-15| 
with the |0-0| bitcoin |1-1| together , |2-3| pay |4-4| and sell |5-6| without |7-7| banks |8-8| 
in contrast to |0-1| the current |2-2| currency |3-3| exchange |4-4| , based on the |5-7| central banks |8-9| , identified |10-11| deals |12-12| and processing |13-14| payments |15-15| between the parties . |16-18| 
in addition , |0-2| how often |3-4| in these |5-6| technologies , |7-8| political vision |9-10| is clear : |11-12| the belief that |13-17| the current |18-18| monetary |19-19| system made up of |20-23| banking |24-24| monopolies , |25-26| leads to |27-28| financial crises |29-30| . |31-31| 
in fact , |0-3| bitcoin |4-4| together |5-5| invented |6-7| ?????? |8-8| nakamoto |9-9| ( a pseudonym ) |10-12| , is |13-14| as |15-15| a virtual |16-16| currency |17-17| ( |18-18| but , |19-20| convertible into |21-22| dollars , |23-24| euros ) |25-26| and secure |27-28| exchange |29-29| as |30-30| bittorrent |32-32| protocol |31-31| that allows you to |33-35| peer @-@ to @-@ |36-39| peer |40-40| currency . |41-42| 
about 200 |0-1| thousand |2-2| deals |3-3| have already been |4-5| recorded |6-6| through |7-7| 15 thousand |8-9| computers in the network |10-12| . |13-13| 
almost |0-0| a thousand web sites |1-2| to accept |3-3| bitcoins |4-4| as |5-5| donations |6-6| or the |7-7| means of payment |8-9| . |10-10| 
the |0-0| bitcoin |1-1| together |2-2| exchange rate |3-4| , |5-5| reaching a peak of |6-8| 30 dollars |9-10| ( 23 |11-12| euros ) |13-14| in june |15-16| 2011 |17-18| , fell to |19-21| 2 |22-22| dollars |23-23| five |24-24| months later |25-26| returned |27-28| today , |29-29| about a dozen |30-31| dollars ( |32-33| prices are |34-35| on the site |36-37| bitcoincharts.com |38-38| ) . |39-40| 
nothing is |0-1| very impressive |2-3| , compared with |4-7| global operations |8-9| in real |10-11| currency or |12-13| financial products |14-15| . |16-16| 
however , |0-0| the european central bank |1-3| ( ecb |4-5| ) has taken |6-7| an interest |8-8| in his |9-10| report |11-12| on the |13-13| virtual |14-14| currency |15-15| published in |16-17| october . |18-19| 
he |0-0| describes the |1-1| bitcoin |2-2| together , |3-4| as &quot; |5-6| the most successful |7-8| virtual currency |9-10| , &quot; |11-12| &quot; in |13-14| competition with |15-16| the dollar |17-17| or |18-18| the euro |19-19| , &quot; and &quot; |20-22| similar to |23-24| the common |25-25| currency |26-26| . &quot; |27-28| 
bitcoin |0-0| together |1-1| is different |2-2| from other |3-4| kinds of |5-5| virtual currency |6-7| , such as the |8-10| &quot; credit &quot; |11-13| for |14-16| the progress of |17-18| a video game |19-19| that |20-21| you win |22-23| by playing |24-25| or that |26-27| you can |28-29| buy ( |30-31| and sometimes |32-34| currency |35-35| in return |36-36| ) . |37-38| 
the social network |0-1| facebook |2-2| also |3-3| has developed |4-4| such a system |5-6| . |7-7| 
but |0-1| on each |2-3| occasion |4-4| , |5-5| the central organ |6-7| of control |8-8| and handles |9-10| exchanges . |11-12| 
with the |0-0| bitcoin |1-1| together , |2-3| all the |4-4| sites |5-5| on the web |6-7| are the custodians of |8-9| the book of |10-10| accounts , |11-12| auditors , |13-14| exchange of |15-15| issuers |16-17| and |18-18| buyers and sellers . |19-22| 
how did |0-1| the network |2-2| work ? |3-4| 
each |0-0| transaction between |1-2| two users |3-4| , actually |5-8| carried out |9-9| between two |10-11| e @-@ mail addresses |12-13| , as |14-15| with |16-16| e @-@ mail . |17-19| 
in addition |0-1| , |2-3| the user can choose |4-6| another address |7-8| for each |9-10| payment |11-11| , thereby |12-14| guaranteeing |15-15| anonymity |16-16| . |17-17|

she |0-0| goes through |1-2| the decision |3-3| of a mathematical |4-4| task |5-5| for computers |6-7| , and |8-9| the winner |10-10| , a kind of |11-13| interim |14-14| central |15-15| banker , |16-17| will be |18-18| able |19-20| to add |21-21| this |22-22| additional |23-23| lines . |24-25| 
this |0-0| file |1-1| hashing |2-2| phase , |3-4| that is |5-6| the transformation |7-7| of a large |8-8| file in |9-10| a shorter |11-12| and a unique |13-14| digital |15-15| imprint |16-16| . |17-17| 
&quot; |1-1| computers |0-0| take |2-2| a &quot; new |3-4| deal and |5-6| add |7-7| next to him |8-10| , |11-12| &quot; hash |13-14| &quot; everything |15-16| up . |17-18| 
the aim |0-0| of the exercises |1-1| to find a |2-4| number that |5-7| gives |8-8| a special |9-9| imprint |10-10| ( |11-11| lots of |12-13| zeros |14-14| in early |15-16| ) . |17-18| 
when |0-0| this number |1-2| was found |3-4| , other |5-6| sites |7-7| can easily |8-9| check |10-10| that this is |11-13| the right one . |14-15| 
the deal |0-0| will |1-1| then |2-2| indestructibly |3-3| associated with |4-5| the chain |6-6| of all |7-7| other operations |8-9| ; any |10-11| modification |12-12| would |13-13| change the |14-14| imprint |15-15| . |16-16| 
if a user |0-1| wants to |2-2| deprive |3-3| by paying |4-5| twice |6-6| for the |7-7| same money |8-10| very quickly |11-12| ( less than 10 |13-15| minutes ) |16-17| , the |18-18| only |19-19| one of the two |20-22| deals |23-23| will be |24-24| approved by |25-25| the network |26-26| - another |27-28| will remain |29-29| an orphan |30-30| , as |31-32| two different |33-34| prints . |35-36| 
a computer that |0-2| solves |3-3| the problem of |4-4| wins |5-5| 50 |6-6| bitcoins |7-7| . |8-8| 
to avoid |0-1| inflation , |2-3| this award is |4-6| regularly |7-7| divided into two |8-10| , probably |11-13| by the end of 2012 |14-17| . |18-18| 
the number of |0-0| bitcoins |1-1| in circulation |2-3| is |4-4| so |5-5| limited to |6-6| 21 million |7-8| , |9-9| but they |10-11| shared |12-12| until the |13-14| millionth |15-15| , |16-16| which leaves |17-18| some |19-19| margin |20-20| ... |21-21| 
the difficulty |0-0| is |1-1| also |2-2| raised |3-3| with the increase |4-5| in |6-6| computing power |7-8| . |9-9| 
life |0-0| of the network |1-1| had its |2-3| ups and downs |4-6| . |7-7| 
web sites |0-2| that provide |3-4| services for |5-6| bitcoin |7-7| together |8-8| were attacked and |9-11| bitcoins |12-12| in |13-13| deposits |14-14| stolen . |15-16| 
&quot; the |0-0| loophole |1-1| is |2-2| not |3-3| the protocol itself |4-5| , &quot; says |6-9| pierre |10-10| noizat |11-11| reassuring |12-12| , who |13-14| has just released the |15-17| paymium |18-18| , |19-19| the real currency |20-21| of payment |22-22| company that |23-25| uses a |26-26| network of |27-27| bitcoin |28-28| together . |29-30| 
the ecb |0-0| also underscores the |1-2| opportunities for |3-4| money laundering |5-6| , |7-7| using this |8-9| anonymous |10-10| . |11-11| 
but |0-0| the money |1-1| also has |2-3| this weakness |4-5| . |6-6| 
the big players |0-1| like |2-3| wikipedia |4-4| to refuse |5-6| donations |7-7| of this kind . |8-10| 
others , such as |0-3| wordpress |4-4| blogging platform |5-7| , |8-8| to take |9-9| them . |10-11| 
recently , |0-1| adi |2-2| shamir |3-3| and |4-4| dorit |5-5| ron , |6-7| from the weizmann institute |8-10| in israel , |11-13| analyzed the |14-14| books |15-16| and showed that |17-20| almost 80 |21-22| % of |23-23| bitcoins |24-24| not |25-25| circulate |26-26| . |27-27| 
in november , the |0-1| &quot; huge |2-3| sell @-@ off |4-4| &quot; |5-5| were launched |6-7| . |8-8| 
&quot; thirty |0-1| thousand dollars |2-3| were exchanged |4-5| &quot; welcomes |6-7| jon |8-8| holmquist , |9-10| who works |11-12| at the |13-13| coinabul |14-14| that |15-16| convert |17-17| bitcoins |18-18| to gold . |19-21| 
pierre |0-0| noizat |1-1| , |2-2| also |3-3| an |5-5| author of |4-4| a book |6-6| on this |7-8| currency , |9-10| has a lot of |11-12| faith in |13-14| the potential of |15-15| this technology |16-17| as |18-18| the transaction |19-19| network . |20-21| 
his |0-0| system , |1-2| paytunia |3-3| , |4-4| equivalent to |5-5| credit card |6-7| ( in |8-9| real money |10-11| ) or |12-13| contactless |14-14| payments |15-15| through |16-16| mobile |17-17| , but |18-19| it uses |20-21| bitcoin |22-22| together to |23-25| confirm the |26-26| deals that |27-29| thus |30-31| cheaper . |32-33| 
in addition |0-1| , the user |2-3| runs |4-4| his |5-5| identity , |6-7| and |8-8| so they |9-10| can be |11-12| anonymous . |13-14| 
the system |0-0| is easy |1-1| to implement |2-2| traders |3-3| who |4-5| do not need to install |6-8| new terminals |9-10| or software |11-13| . |14-14| 
they just |0-1| need to |2-2| provide the |3-3| address , |4-5| phone can |6-7| &quot; photos |8-9| and recognize |10-11| , &quot; says |12-15| pierre |16-16| noizat |17-17| , which |18-19| confirms that |20-22| it has |23-24| thousands of |25-25| users . |26-27| 
there is |0-0| a general |1-1| movement |2-2| to overestimate the |3-3| hierarchical systems |4-5| for more |6-7| horizontal |8-8| systems . |9-10| 
&quot; |0-0| it will take time |1-2| for the |3-3| bitcoin |4-4| together to |5-7| become |8-8| firmly established |9-9| , but |10-11| in 2013 |12-14| may become |15-16| a turning point , &quot; |17-21| he |23-23| predicts |22-22| . |24-24| 
the ecb |0-0| , in |1-2| his report |3-4| , he says , |5-8| will reassess |9-9| the various |10-10| risks |11-11| , currently |12-15| seen as |16-17| high , |18-19| if successful |20-22| currency . |23-24| 
we |0-0| came out of |1-2| afghanistan . |3-4| 
what |0-0| now ? |1-2| 
french troops |0-1| left their |2-3| areas of |4-4| responsibility |5-5| in afghanistan |6-7| ( in the |8-8| kapisa |9-10| and |11-11| surobi |12-12| ) . |13-14| 
nato and the |0-1| americans have |2-3| due to |4-4| follow |5-5| at the end |6-7| of 2014 . |8-10| 
it is time |0-1| for the |2-2| afghan army |3-4| to resume |5-5| their territory and |7-9| possession |6-6| of the afghan people |10-11| to choose |12-12| their future |13-14| , not |15-16| expecting |17-19| us to |20-20| do everything |21-22| . |23-23| 
it is |0-0| mostly |1-2| afghan |3-3| farmers |4-4| that we should |5-8| be penalised |9-9| regarding |10-10| them as |11-12| terrorists . |13-14| 
and |0-0| ourselves , |1-3| with our |4-5| 88 |6-6| soldiers killed |7-9| and wounded |10-11| , lame |12-13| . |14-14| 
the taliban |0-2| consists of |3-4| foreign |5-5| extremists , |6-7| the former |8-8| leaders in |9-10| asylum in |11-12| pakistan , |13-14| but often |15-16| peasants who |17-19| refuse to |20-20| the presence |21-21| of foreign |22-22| military forces |23-24| , as |25-26| in soviet times . |27-30| 
they want to |0-1| protect their |2-3| traditions , |4-5| such as |6-6| ancient |7-7| and archaic |8-9| , although |10-11| they |12-12| were joined by |13-13| jihadists |14-14| , |15-15| pakistanis |16-16| , arabs |17-18| , uzbeks |19-20| , |21-21| tajiks |22-22| . |23-23| 
tolerated |0-0| , sometimes |1-2| helped |3-3| by |4-4| local |5-5| rebels , |6-7| the latter |8-8| will no longer be |9-11| so when |12-14| the west |15-15| has become more |16-17| scarce |18-18| . |19-19| 
the withdrawal |0-0| of french |1-1| troops from |2-3| nijrab |4-4| base , |5-6| which i |7-8| watched |9-9| from the top |10-11| of the hills |12-12| ?????????? |13-13| trees |14-14| with |15-15| french |16-16| finance |17-17| , |18-18| was conducted |19-20| in an orderly manner |21-21| . |22-22| 
convoys |0-0| of trucks |1-1| and |2-2| armoured vehicles |3-3| reached |4-4| kabul |5-5| without being |6-8| attacked |9-9| , |10-10| they are |11-11| using |12-13| helicopters . |14-15| 
will not be a |0-1| wave of |2-2| the taliban |3-3| in kabul |4-5| , by the end |6-8| of 2014 . |9-11| 
the circumstances |0-0| have changed |1-1| after the |2-2| irresistible |3-3| advance |4-4| between |5-5| 1994 and |6-7| 1996 . |8-10| 
at this time in |0-3| kabul |4-4| was empty |5-6| , in a country |7-10| torn by |11-11| a struggle |12-12| between different |13-14| factions . |15-16| 
their |0-0| capture |1-1| of the country |2-2| were |3-3| perceived |4-4| as |5-7| a kind of |8-9| liberation , |10-11| a return to |12-13| safety . |14-15| 
afghans |0-0| paid the |1-1| price of |2-2| obscurantism |3-3| these |4-4| farmers |5-5| through |6-6| the organization of |7-7| al @-@ qaeda |8-12| , but |13-14| their situation |15-16| has not improved . |17-19| 
the former |0-0| ??????????? |1-1| , |2-2| the afghan government and |3-5| the |6-6| taliban |7-7| allies |8-8| of wanting |9-10| to keep |11-11| women in |12-13| the rankings |14-14| . |15-15| 
chief of the |0-0| anti @-@ soviet |1-1| war |2-2| leaders |3-3| returned |4-4| to power |5-6| in 2001 . |7-10| 
they have become |0-1| speculators |2-2| , |3-3| seizing power |4-5| to |6-7| resell the |8-8| land for |9-10| the construction of the |11-11| land for |12-13| refugees |14-15| returning from |16-17| iran and pakistan |18-20| , benefiting |21-23| from |24-24| the huge |25-25| american |26-26| outsourcing |27-27| contracts . |28-29| 
they were |0-1| discredited |2-2| ; indeed |3-5| , most of them |6-9| not |10-10| to fight |11-11| for themselves |12-12| . |13-13| 
people , |0-1| as i |2-3| have heard |4-4| in the countryside , |5-8| want |9-11| a government that is |12-14| not |15-15| one of |16-16| the thieves |17-17| . |18-18| 
many young |0-1| people want to |2-3| leave |4-4| , as |5-6| those who |7-9| will be able |10-10| to benefit from the |11-13| american |14-14| generosity |15-15| will leave |16-16| : |17-17| capital flight |18-19| is considerable . |20-22| 
young people |0-1| are tired of |2-3| the war and its |4-6| ideology . |7-8| 
they have |0-1| rubbed |2-2| shoulders |3-3| with |4-4| the modern world |5-6| during their |7-9| exile |10-10| in iran |11-12| and pakistan |13-14| , and |15-16| appreciated the advantages |17-18| . |19-19| 
about 65 |0-1| % of the population |2-3| is less than |4-5| 25 ; |6-7| kabul |8-8| now |9-9| has 5 |10-11| million people |12-13| , |14-14| one @-@ fifth of |15-16| the population |17-17| . |18-18| 
in cities |0-1| and |2-2| public schools |3-4| are |5-5| complete , |6-7| with the |8-8| girls and |9-10| boys . |11-12| 
it is necessary to provide |0-1| jobs |2-2| for those |3-4| young people |5-6| who do not want |7-10| to return to the |11-12| obscurantism |13-13| former |14-14| party |15-15| or corruption |16-17| of some |18-18| leaders . |19-20| 
all of them , |0-2| including armed |3-4| opponents |5-5| are |6-7| private |8-8| for mobile |9-10| phones , |11-12| tvs |13-13| with her |14-15| turkish |16-16| soap operas |17-18| , |19-19| show that |20-22| the modern world |23-24| , &quot; was his |25-27| everywhere . |28-29| 
the army |0-0| now . |1-2| 
will the |0-1| authorities |2-2| that |3-4| the team |5-5| is |6-6| considered |7-7| legitimate |8-8| ? |9-9| 
the former |0-0| commanders of the |1-1| anti @-@ soviet |2-2| struggle |3-3| is already |4-4| thinking about |5-6| restoring |7-7| provincial |8-8| militias |9-9| that |10-11| would avoid the |12-13| central authorities . |14-16| 
afghanistan |0-0| , a |1-1| land |2-2| of mountains |3-3| , |4-4| with a strong |5-6| national identity |7-8| , |9-9| should be able |10-12| to benefit from |13-15| some |16-16| decentralization |17-17| , |18-18| in the image and likeness |19-22| of western countries , |23-25| but the united states |26-28| wanted to |29-29| turn it into a |30-32| centralized |33-33| state , |34-35| with a strong |36-37| presidential |38-38| power , |39-40| abolishing |41-41| the post of prime minister |42-45| , |46-46| which existed |47-48| from the |49-49| 1964 |50-50| constitution . |51-52| 
president karzai |0-1| does not want |2-3| any |4-4| foreign |5-5| control , |6-7| especially |8-9| on the occasion of |10-11| the elections |12-12| in april |13-14| of 2014 . |15-17| 
but , |0-1| since |2-3| the 1950s |4-7| and |8-8| has already |9-9| long before |10-14| his country |15-16| was |17-17| dependent on foreign aid |18-21| . |22-22| 
there is no |0-0| industry |1-1| has been restored |2-3| , no |4-5| dams |6-6| are in good condition |7-10| , |11-11| no significant |12-13| irrigation systems |14-15| have been rehabilitated |16-17| . |18-18| 
all of |0-0| it is |1-1| imported |2-2| ; |3-3| nothing |4-4| except the |5-6| fruits and |7-8| vegetables . |9-10| 
remains |1-1| a priority |0-0| for |2-2| private initiative |3-4| . |5-5| 
in a country |0-1| destroyed by the |2-2| thirty years |3-4| war , |5-6| government control over |7-9| infrastructure |10-10| , it would be |11-13| necessary . |14-15| 
this |0-0| rumor |1-1| was |2-3| that afghanistan |4-6| has had |7-7| huge mineral |8-9| wealth . |10-11| 
it is |0-0| only |1-1| heightened the |2-2| sense |3-3| that the |4-5| europeans were |6-7| only there |8-9| so as not to |10-12| miss . |13-14| 
without the |0-0| energy for |1-2| processing of |3-3| ore |4-4| or copper |5-6| on the spot , |7-9| or |10-10| vehicles |11-12| for |13-13| its exports |14-15| through the |16-16| mountains , |17-18| not . |19-20| 
the chinese |0-0| already |1-1| almost |2-2| left the |3-3| mes |4-4| aynak |5-5| copper mine |6-7| , leaving |8-9| international |10-10| archaeologists |11-11| ( |12-12| funded by |13-13| the world bank |14-15| ) |16-16| to search for a |17-18| huge |19-19| buddhist |20-20| site and |21-22| remain |23-23| the largest |24-24| employer |25-25| in the province . |26-28| 
once she |0-1| , too , |2-2| would be necessary |3-4| for afghanistan and pakistan |5-8| , which |9-11| is heavily dependent on |12-16| imports and |17-18| exports |19-19| to restore |20-22| normal relations |23-24| . |25-25| 
the withdrawal |0-0| of french |1-1| troops |2-2| was completed |3-4| on november 20 |5-6| . |7-7| 
a new |0-0| cooperation agreement |1-3| provides for the |4-4| continuation of the |5-5| traditional |6-6| aid : |7-8| school |9-9| girls , |10-11| boys , |12-13| the french |14-14| department |15-15| at the university |16-17| , the french |18-19| institute , |20-21| cooperation in |22-23| the military |24-24| , legal |25-26| , medical |27-28| and agricultural |29-30| fields , |31-32| support for |33-33| archaeological |34-34| delegation . |35-36|

these projects |0-1| , |2-2| with the participation of |3-4| a large number of |5-6| local |7-7| labor |8-8| , |9-9| have helped |10-10| keep |11-11| the rebels |12-12| : |13-13| irrigation , |14-15| wells |16-16| , drinking water , |17-20| reforestation |21-21| , fruit |22-23| trees , |24-25| soil protection and |26-28| increase in |29-29| part of |30-30| the |31-31| areas . |32-33| 
what |0-2| we will |3-4| leave |5-5| as a souvenir |6-7| , after |8-9| two billion |10-11| euros of |12-12| military spending |13-14| ? |15-15| 
a much more |0-1| modest |2-2| budget |3-3| will help to improve |4-6| local |7-7| living conditions |8-9| that are very difficult |10-13| in these |14-15| valleys |16-16| is often |17-18| more than 2,000 |19-21| meters |22-22| above sea level . |23-26|

while |0-3| egypt |4-4| remains divided |5-6| more |7-7| than ever |8-12| around the |13-13| constitutional declaration |14-15| , which |16-17| temporarily |18-18| grants |19-19| his |20-20| powers , |21-22| he decided |23-24| to go for |25-26| broke |27-27| . |28-28| 
taking |0-0| everyone by surprise |1-2| , |3-3| he announced |4-5| on wednesday |6-7| that the |8-9| constituent assembly |10-11| will |12-12| vote |13-13| on |14-15| the final |16-16| text of |17-17| the next day . |18-21| 
only a week ago |0-2| , |3-3| the head of state |4-5| gave |6-6| the assembly |7-7| another two |8-9| months |10-10| to complete |11-11| its work |12-13| . |14-14| 
within two years , |0-3| egypt |4-4| relied on |5-6| temporary |7-7| text , |8-9| amended |10-11| several times , |12-15| and it |16-17| has weakened |18-18| the institutional |19-19| stability and |20-21| led to |22-23| legal |24-24| imbroglios |25-25| . |26-26| 
this new |0-1| initiative |2-2| has led |3-3| only |4-4| to |5-5| widen the gap |6-7| in the country . |8-10| 
according to his |0-2| opponents , |3-4| the president is |5-6| insistent |7-7| in his |8-9| &quot; |10-10| autocratic |11-11| nonsense |12-12| , &quot; |13-15| continues to |16-16| &quot; go back |17-18| on |19-19| his word |20-21| &quot; and &quot; |22-24| ???????? |25-25| law |26-26| . &quot; |27-28| 
his supporters |0-1| argue that |2-4| it is |5-5| the fastest way to |6-8| put an end to the |9-10| institutional and |11-12| political crisis |13-14| , |15-15| speeding up |16-16| the process of |17-17| transition . |18-19| 
the referendum |0-0| must |1-1| be held |2-2| within the next two |3-6| weeks . |7-8| 
in a very short |0-1| period , |2-3| which makes |4-5| the brothers |6-6| to abandon |7-8| his plan |9-10| to explain |11-13| the text |14-14| of article |15-15| by |16-16| article , |17-18| egyptians |19-19| . |20-20| 
for the president |0-1| , |2-2| it is also a |3-4| way to achieve |5-6| the popular |7-7| and democratic |8-9| legitimacy |10-10| , although |11-12| the dispute |13-13| goes |14-14| across the country . |15-18| 
mohammed |0-0| morsi |1-1| , it seems , |2-4| are convinced |5-5| that the |6-7| egyptians |8-8| will vote |9-9| conveniently |10-10| , as |11-12| he said |13-14| in an interview with |15-16| the us |17-17| weekly |18-18| time |19-19| . |20-20| 
especially |0-0| after a hasty |1-2| vote |3-3| smacks of |4-4| egyptian people |6-7| an ultimatum |5-5| : &quot; |8-9| either |10-10| you vote |11-12| for my |13-14| texts , |15-16| or |17-17| i keep |18-19| powers , |20-21| &quot; |22-22| these forces |23-24| allegedly |25-25| expiring |26-26| after the adoption |27-28| of the constitution |29-29| . |30-30| 
it was |0-1| a |2-2| strange |3-3| atmosphere |4-4| that the |5-6| 85 |7-7| @-@ member |8-8| constituent assembly |9-10| , |11-11| with large |12-13| islamist |14-14| majority , |15-16| voted |17-17| for the |18-18| text |19-19| yesterday . |20-21| 
majority of |0-0| the liberals |1-1| were lost |2-3| . |4-4| 
in |0-0| mid @-@ november , |1-2| shortly before the |3-4| constitutional declaration |5-6| , they |7-8| slammed |9-9| the door |10-10| , feeling |11-13| they failed to |14-16| approve |17-17| their views |18-19| . |20-20| 
representatives of human rights |0-1| , |2-2| religious minorities |3-4| or |5-5| civil society |6-7| was done |8-9| likewise |10-11| . |12-12| 
in order to get |0-3| a quorum |4-4| , 11 |5-6| members , |7-8| deputies |9-9| were |10-11| hastily |12-12| added |13-13| yesterday morning |14-15| . |16-16| 
some of them are |0-2| very close to the |3-5| muslim brotherhood |6-9| . |10-10| 
it is not surprising |0-1| that the |2-3| articles were |4-5| for the most part |6-8| voted |9-9| unanimously . |10-11| 
commentators |0-0| were also |1-2| surprised that |3-5| the only |6-6| sabotage |7-7| the day |8-8| was expressed |9-10| in terms of |11-12| ... |13-13| an hour |14-14| of prayer |15-15| , |16-16| some members |17-18| of the committee of |19-19| the feeling that |20-22| the constituent assembly |23-24| clock |25-25| was wrong |26-27| . |28-28| 
the text |0-0| , which |1-2| was still |3-4| being |5-5| voted |6-6| on |7-7| yesterday evening |8-9| , already |10-11| 234 |12-12| articles . |13-14| 
the main |0-0| focus |1-1| of attention |2-2| , article 2 , |3-6| remains |7-7| ultimately the |8-11| 1971 |12-12| constitution |13-13| , stressing that |14-17| &quot; |18-18| the principles |19-19| of sharia |20-20| are the main source of |21-23| law |24-24| . &quot; |25-26| 
the salafist |0-0| party , |1-2| for which |3-4| the establishment of |5-5| islamic law |6-7| is the main |8-9| claim |10-10| , |11-11| had hoped |12-12| to replace |13-14| the &quot; |15-15| principles |16-16| , &quot; &quot; |17-19| rules &quot; |20-21| that would allow |22-25| tougher |26-27| statements . |28-29| 
for the |0-0| islamists , |1-2| the fact that |3-6| this article |7-8| was not |9-10| changed |11-11| is a guarantee of |12-13| their |14-14| goodwill |15-16| and respect |17-18| to other |19-20| elements of |21-21| egyptian society |22-23| . |24-24| 
the &quot; |0-0| hypocrisy |1-1| &quot; |2-2| response to |3-3| liberals who |4-6| see only |7-8| the communications |9-9| revolution . |10-11| 
because , |0-2| in their view , |3-6| the islamization of the |7-7| constitution |8-8| is done |9-9| through |10-10| other |11-11| articles . |12-13| 
they |0-0| include |1-1| , in particular , |2-5| article |6-6| 220 |7-7| , which |8-9| provides the |10-10| al @-@ azhar university |11-14| advisory |15-15| role , |16-17| with particular emphasis on |18-21| tests in |22-23| accordance with |24-25| sharia law |26-27| . |28-28| 
according to |0-0| egyptian |1-1| specialist |2-2| sophie |3-3| pommier |4-4| , |5-5| it is |6-6| alarming |7-7| because &quot; |8-11| people are |12-12| called on |13-13| to |14-14| advise that |15-15| are not elected , |16-18| and |19-19| have no |20-21| democratic |22-22| legitimacy . |23-24| 
this suggests |0-1| the beginning of |2-2| theocracy |3-3| . &quot; |4-5| 
the liberals |0-0| &apos; |1-1| fears |2-2| also |3-3| have been fuelled |4-4| by the fact that |5-8| the next |9-9| chancellor |10-10| of the university |11-11| will probably be |12-15| much more |16-17| moderate |18-18| than the current one . |19-22| 
&quot; at the moment |0-3| there is no |4-5| specific |6-6| religious |7-7| overtones |8-8| . |9-9| 
with this |0-1| constitution , |2-3| things |4-4| remain |5-5| under |6-6| civilian |7-7| rule . |8-9| 
most lawyers |0-1| who have worked |2-4| on |5-5| this text |6-7| is not |8-8| islamic law |9-10| scholars , |11-12| academics |13-13| , some |14-15| trained |16-16| in the french |17-18| system &quot; |19-20| qualifies |21-21| alexis |22-22| blouet |23-23| who |24-25| wrote |26-26| a thesis on |27-28| the egyptian |29-29| constitution |30-30| of the transition . |31-33| 
but |0-0| he admits that |1-4| &quot; maybe |5-8| there is some |9-10| uncertainty about |11-13| the article |14-14| 220 |15-15| , because the |16-18| terms used |19-21| on loan |22-22| with religious |23-24| terms . |25-26| 
the link |0-0| is made |1-1| , in particular , |2-5| &quot; |6-6| fiqh |7-7| &quot; &#91; |8-9| islamic jurisprudence |10-11| , |12-12| ed |13-14| . |15-15| &#93; . |16-17| 
and |0-0| this question |1-2| may be offered |3-5| in the future , |6-8| the extent to which |9-11| the civil |12-12| judges |13-13| are competent |14-14| to pronounce |15-15| on it . &quot; |16-19| 
for its |0-1| religious aspect |2-3| , the |4-4| text on |5-6| the vote |7-7| yesterday |8-8| highly |9-9| criticized |10-10| in connection |11-12| with |13-13| broad powers |14-15| , it |16-17| gives the president |18-19| of the republic . |20-21| 
the brothers |0-2| say they |3-6| are significantly reduced |7-8| compared |9-10| with what |11-14| they were |15-16| under the |17-17| former |18-18| regime . |19-20| 
another |0-1| question : |2-3| of the powers conferred |4-6| on the |7-7| army . |8-9| 
in accordance |0-1| with the wishes |2-3| of the military |4-4| , the |5-5| defense budget |6-7| will be |8-9| submitted to the |10-12| parliament |13-13| , but |14-15| the national council |17-18| for the |16-16| defense . |19-20| 
neither the |0-0| trials |1-1| of civilians |2-3| will be |4-4| banned in |5-6| military |7-7| tribunals |8-8| , |9-9| at the request |10-11| of the association |12-12| for the protection |13-14| of human rights . |15-17| 
who |0-1| voice |2-2| their concerns |3-4| about the |5-6| text |7-7| , which |8-9| they consider |10-11| repressive |12-12| . |13-13| 
the crime of |0-0| blasphemy |1-1| is supported and |2-3| insults |4-4| now |5-5| smoking , |6-7| which could |8-9| have serious |10-11| implications for |12-13| freedom of speech |14-15| , especially |16-17| for the press . |18-20| 
in addition , |0-2| no longer |3-4| makes |5-5| any of |6-7| the articles |8-8| are related to |9-10| the protection of women |11-12| , |13-13| said |14-14| heba |15-15| morayef |16-16| , of |17-18| human rights watch |19-21| . |22-22| 
in her opinion , |0-3| the only |4-4| positive element |5-6| is the |7-7| ban on |8-9| torture |10-11| in article |12-13| 36 . |14-15| 
the word |0-0| was not included in the |1-4| previous |5-5| constitution . |6-7| 
although the |0-0| egyptian president |1-2| said |3-3| last night |4-5| on tv |6-7| , |8-8| rallies |9-9| are planned for |10-11| this day |12-13| . |14-14|

so far , |0-0| lawmakers |1-1| and |2-2| human rights activists |3-3| say about |4-5| the purpose |6-6| of the law |7-7| on mandatory |8-9| language testing |10-11| , the country already |12-14| fraudsters |15-15| who |16-17| sell |18-18| fake |19-19| certificates . |20-21|

their only |0-1| goal is |2-3| to earn |4-4| money |5-5| to support the |6-7| families |8-8| back home |9-9| . |10-10| 
the new law |0-1| came into force |2-4| on december 1 |5-6| , which obliges |7-9| each |10-10| migrant worker |11-13| to pass |14-14| a test |15-15| in the russian language |16-18| . |19-19| 
for the moment , |0-2| this law |3-4| only applies to |5-7| those who intend to |8-11| work |12-12| in services |13-15| , |16-16| housing and |17-18| utilities |19-20| , domestic |21-22| services and |23-24| retail trade |25-26| . |27-27| 
but with |0-1| the passage of time |2-3| - as |4-5| promised |6-6| by the federal |7-7| migration service |8-9| - testing |10-11| will be |12-12| mandatory |13-13| for all |14-15| non @-@ residents |16-16| . |17-17| 
in addition to the |0-2| language , |3-4| history of |5-5| russia and the |6-7| basics |8-8| of the legal system |9-10| will be |11-11| tested |12-12| . |13-13| 
knowledge of the |0-0| language |1-1| should be confirmed by |2-4| both |5-5| receive and |6-7| extend the |8-8| work permit . |9-12| 
an exception |0-0| is in |1-2| force only |3-4| for the citizens of |5-6| countries where |7-9| english |10-11| is the |12-12| official language |13-14| . |15-15|

goal , |0-1| doomed |2-2| destiny , |3-4| and the |5-5| protection of human rights |6-8| 
the seven |0-0| test |1-1| points |2-2| will work |3-4| under the auspices |5-6| of the institute |7-7| of the russian language |8-9| name |10-10| pushkin , |11-12| peoples &apos; friendship university |13-15| of russia , |16-17| moscow state university |18-20| ( msu |21-22| ) , st. |23-26| petersburg state |27-28| university ( |29-30| spbgu |31-31| ) and |32-33| other russian |34-35| institutions |36-37| . |38-38| 
migrants |0-0| can pass |1-2| the tests |3-3| in all |4-5| cities ; |6-7| more than 160 |8-9| such |10-10| centers |11-11| were opened |12-13| . |14-14| 
the initiative |0-0| to introduce |1-2| testing |3-3| was supported by the |4-5| deputies |6-6| of the state duma |7-8| and |9-9| the federal |10-10| migration service |11-12| . |13-13| 
however , |0-0| human rights activists |1-1| , |2-2| asked a |3-3| question that |4-6| many times |7-8| in the press |9-10| before |11-13| the law |14-14| came into effect |15-17| : |18-18| what will it |19-20| achieve ? |21-22| 
what will be |0-1| required to |2-2| know |3-3| the russian |4-4| changes |5-5| for the russians |6-7| and for |8-10| non @-@ residents |11-11| ? |12-12| 
first , |0-3| according to |4-5| representatives of the |6-6| migration service |7-8| , it |9-10| would reduce |11-12| the number of people |13-15| suffering from |16-17| labor |18-18| slavery . |19-20| 
many say |0-1| about the |2-2| protection of the rights of |3-4| migrant workers , |5-7| explains the |8-8| head of |9-10| the federal |11-11| migration service |12-14| , viktor |15-16| sebelev |17-17| . |18-18| 
the protection of human rights |0-2| must begin |3-4| before |5-5| his retirement |6-7| . |8-8| 
only |0-0| the system |1-1| organized |2-2| selection |3-3| will allow us to |4-5| solve the |6-6| problems of |9-9| 90 % |7-8| of foreign |10-10| workers . |11-12| 
migrants |0-0| without |1-1| profession |2-2| , education |3-4| who do not know |5-8| the russians |9-9| who do not have a |10-13| medical certificate |14-15| to start |16-16| there are |17-17| problems . |18-19| 
if |0-0| a migrant |1-1| does not understand the |2-3| language , |4-5| &quot; says |6-6| sebelev |7-7| with confidence |8-9| , he |10-11| is doomed |12-12| to come |13-13| through the |14-14| unscrupulous people |15-16| who are |17-18| trying to |19-20| help , |21-22| will make |23-23| his &quot; |24-25| ticket |26-26| &quot; for |27-28| grozny |29-29| , cramped |30-31| barracks |32-32| , where |33-34| many others |35-36| like |37-38| him |39-39| will suffer |40-41| without food |42-43| and documents |44-45| , a |46-46| party of |47-47| 12 |48-48| @-@ 14 |49-50| hours a |51-52| day . |53-54| 
we get |0-1| a lot |2-2| of complaints |3-3| from our |4-5| migrants . |6-7| 
&quot; |0-0| they promised |1-2| one |3-3| at home , |4-5| but when |6-7| they come |8-9| , they |10-11| lied |12-12| , their |13-14| passports |15-15| , they are not |16-18| paid |19-19| what they were promised |20-20| , &quot; |21-23| confirms the |24-24| head of |25-26| migrant labour |27-29| administration of the |30-30| migration service |31-32| tajikistan |33-33| tolib |34-34| sharipov |35-35| . |36-36| 
don &apos;t |0-0| be angry |1-1| , boss |2-3| ! |4-4| 
nevertheless , |0-3| many |4-4| citizens of |5-5| the countries of central |6-7| asia |8-8| , which |9-10| are planning |11-11| to go to |12-12| work in |13-14| russia , |15-16| recognize that |17-19| not only |20-21| their understanding of the |22-23| language of |24-24| the country in which |25-28| they are |29-30| not so |31-32| good , |33-34| but they |35-36| can hardly |37-39| write |40-40| in their own language |41-44| . |45-45| 
of course , it &apos;s |0-2| not |3-4| their fault |5-6| , but because of |7-11| poverty |12-12| : |13-13| very few |14-15| turks , |16-17| uzbeks and |18-19| tajiks |20-20| can afford |21-23| even |24-24| basic education . |25-27| 
their families |0-1| don &apos;t even have |2-4| food to feed |5-9| their children |10-11| , not to mention |12-16| a decent |17-17| clothes , shoes |18-20| and |21-22| supplies . |23-24| 
after |0-0| reaching |1-1| adolescence |2-3| , these children |4-6| go |7-7| to work |8-8| at the first opportunity |9-12| . |13-13| 
it is difficult |0-0| , if |1-2| knowledge of the language |3-4| is |5-6| bad , |7-8| they recognize |9-10| . |11-11| 
&quot; |0-0| you feel |1-3| humiliated and |4-5| worse |6-6| . &quot; |7-8| 
however , |0-0| human rights activists |1-1| say |2-2| one important |3-4| point |5-5| about the |6-6| law on |7-8| language . |9-10| 
the tests will |0-1| be carried out only |2-3| for those |4-5| migrants |6-6| who have |7-9| legal status . |10-12| 
if they |0-1| have no status |2-5| will not be |6-8| testing |9-9| , no |10-11| official |12-12| work |13-13| in the future . |14-16| 
meanwhile |0-1| , the majority |2-3| of migrant workers |4-6| continue to |7-7| live |8-8| in russia |9-10| illegally . |11-12| 
&quot; welcome |0-2| , or |3-4| unauthorized |5-5| entry |6-6| &quot; no |7-8| 
many foreigners |0-1| say they |2-4| have received |5-5| official status |6-7| in our country is |8-10| not so simple . |11-14| 
the reason is the |0-2| bureaucratic red tape |3-4| and the already mentioned |5-7| language |8-8| difficulties . |9-10| 
in addition , |0-2| the legalization of |3-3| costs money |4-5| : from |6-7| 12 to |8-9| 16 thousand |10-11| rubles . |12-13| 
while the |0-3| fake |4-4| registration |5-5| is done |6-6| quickly and |7-8| costs just |9-10| one and a half thousand |11-12| . |13-13| 
employees of |0-0| the russian |1-1| police |2-2| know that we |3-6| basically |7-8| were |9-9| fake |10-10| documents |11-12| without registration , |13-15| hence the |16-17| extortion . |18-19| 
&quot; they |0-1| are asking for |2-2| a century |3-3| or two |4-5| on |6-6| cigarettes , |7-8| tea , |9-10| &quot; |11-11| umed |12-12| khushkadamov |13-13| , |14-14| a citizen |15-15| of tajikistan |16-16| , |17-17| shared with |18-19| journalists . |20-21| 
&quot; roll up |0-2| , |3-3| may not be |4-6| cheap |7-8| to get |9-9| their |10-10| works of art |11-12| . &quot; |13-13| 
on the first |0-1| day of the |2-2| law came into force |3-6| , |7-7| it turned out that |8-10| not only |11-12| migrant |13-13| registration documents |14-15| may be |16-17| fake . |18-19| 
several |0-0| fake |1-1| certificates |2-2| on the |3-4| language |5-5| tests were |6-7| seized by |8-8| the federal |9-9| migration service |10-11| officers |12-12| already |13-13| . |14-14| 
fake |0-0| documents are printed on |1-3| a |4-4| color printer |5-6| . |7-7|

in addition to the |0-2| increase of |3-3| low wages |4-6| received |7-8| by employees of |9-9| walmart |10-10| and |11-11| fast food chains |12-14| , |15-15| the aim |16-16| of the protesters |17-17| is the establishment of |18-19| trade unions |20-20| in them . |21-23| 
this sector |0-1| of the economy |2-2| is not |3-3| covered by |4-4| the |5-5| trade union movement . |6-8| 
the 46 |0-0| cents |1-1| per year |2-3| ? |4-4| 
the action |0-0| began |1-1| last week |2-4| after |5-5| thanksgiving day |6-7| , on |8-9| black |10-10| friday |11-11| , when |12-13| the mass |14-14| sale |15-15| drew |16-16| millions of people |17-18| in america |19-20| , sometimes |21-22| accompanied by |23-23| clashes . |24-25| 
on this day |0-2| , some |3-4| employees of |5-5| walmart |6-6| corporation , |7-8| which |9-9| has |10-10| 2.2 million |11-12| people around the world |13-16| , have left |17-18| their jobs and |19-22| took part in the |23-25| picket |26-26| , along |27-27| with trade unions |28-29| and |30-30| left @-@ wing |31-31| activists |32-32| from |33-33| corporations |34-34| shops |35-35| that sell |36-38| products |39-39| for people |40-41| with low |42-43| and middle |44-45| incomes . |46-47| 
walmart |0-0| sells |1-1| all possible |2-3| , from |4-5| diapers |6-6| , |7-7| hunting |8-8| rifles |9-9| and |10-10| car |11-11| batteries , |12-13| vacuum cleaners , |14-15| eggs and |16-17| milk . |18-19| 
the products |0-0| in |1-1| their stores |2-3| on average |4-5| 8 |6-6| % to |7-8| 27 % |9-10| cheaper than |11-13| in large |14-15| supermarkets |16-16| . |17-17| 
so |0-0| many |1-1| low @-@ wage |2-2| workers , |3-3| walmart |5-5| store |4-4| only at |6-7| his |8-8| workplace . |9-11| 
availability and |0-1| range of |2-2| walmart |4-4| has made |3-3| one of the |5-6| largest u.s. |7-8| corporations . |9-10| 
critics said that |0-3| walmart |4-4| can |5-5| afford to |6-7| sell |8-8| products |9-9| cheaply |10-10| , |11-11| partly because |12-15| he pays |16-17| little |18-18| for their employees . |19-22| 
these last |0-1| also complain about |2-4| the difficult |5-5| working conditions |6-7| , for example , |8-10| the lack of |11-11| loaders |12-12| and |13-13| hand @-@ held |14-14| scanners |15-15| . |16-16| 
the protesters |0-0| on |1-1| black |2-2| friday |3-3| demanded |4-4| higher |5-5| wages and |6-7| complained that |8-12| the cost of |13-13| health insurance |14-15| provided by |16-17| the corporation |18-18| went |19-19| from 30 to 100 |20-23| dollars a month . |24-27| 
a typical |0-0| walmart |1-1| employee |2-2| , earning |3-4| $ |6-6| 9.5 |5-5| per hour |7-8| , |9-9| cannot afford |10-13| it . |14-15| 
scientists |0-0| from the university of |1-2| berkeley |3-3| in california |4-5| argue that if |6-9| walmart |10-10| raises |11-11| the average salary |12-13| to 12 |14-15| dollars |16-16| per hour |17-18| , |19-19| it would cost |20-22| the company |23-23| $ 3.2 billion |24-26| . |27-27| 
it is |0-0| about |1-1| 1.1 % |2-3| more than it |4-7| spends on |8-9| salaries |10-10| right now |11-12| . |13-13| 
if |0-0| walmart |1-1| full |2-2| shifts |3-3| costs |4-4| to increase |5-5| wages |6-7| on the |8-8| shoulders |9-9| of consumers |10-10| , each |11-12| visit to |13-14| the store |15-15| would cost |16-17| a total |18-18| of 46 |19-19| cents . |20-21| 
in |0-0| one year |1-2| , they will |3-5| only |6-6| spend |7-7| $ |9-9| 12.39 |8-8| more |10-10| than now . |11-14| 
walmart |0-0| supporters |1-1| gleefully |2-2| note that the |3-5| protests |6-6| were held |7-7| in nine |8-9| states and |10-11| won &apos;t cause any |12-14| damage |15-15| at all |16-17| to the |18-18| corporation . |19-20| 
black friday |0-1| continued |2-2| at its stores |3-5| from 8 |6-7| p.m. to |8-9| midnight |10-10| on thursday |11-12| on the next day |13-15| , and |16-17| during the |18-19| walmart |20-20| has sold |21-21| about 5,000 |22-23| products |24-24| seconds . |25-26| 
in general |0-1| , its |2-3| cash |4-4| spent almost |5-6| 100 million |7-8| deals |9-9| on |10-10| black |11-11| friday |12-12| . |13-13| 
a spokesman for |0-0| the corporation |1-1| , dan |2-3| fogelman |4-4| , said |5-6| in an interview |7-8| with the |9-9| left @-@ wing |10-10| site the |11-11| huffington post |12-13| that a total of |14-18| &quot; |19-19| less than five |20-21| &quot; |22-22| walmart |23-23| employees |24-24| left the |25-25| workplace |26-27| , and |28-29| to protest |30-32| the act |33-33| was just |34-35| &quot; |36-36| another |37-37| pr |38-39| stunt |40-40| &quot; |41-41| union |42-42| , which |43-44| organized |45-45| it . |46-47| 
the &quot; |0-0| free cash |1-2| register |3-3| ! &quot; |4-5| 
protests continued |0-1| this week |2-4| in new york city |5-8| , where the |9-11| object |12-12| was not |13-14| walmart |15-15| ( |16-16| they are not |17-18| so |19-19| happy |20-20| in |21-21| progressive |22-22| cities , |23-24| so they |25-26| don &apos;t exist |27-28| here |29-29| yet ) |30-31| , but |32-33| mcdonald &apos;s |34-36| and other |37-38| cheap |39-39| restaurants . |40-41| 
mcdonald &apos;s |0-2| says he |3-6| sells |7-7| billions of |8-8| portions |9-9| , |10-10| and , |11-12| despite this , |13-16| it doesn &apos;t even |17-19| give you a |20-21| hospital |22-22| or pay |23-24| you for |25-26| work |27-28| ! |29-29| 
jumaane |0-0| williams |1-1| , a member of the |2-3| city council |4-5| of new york |6-8| 
at the moment , |0-3| the minimum wage in |4-7| accordance |8-8| with federal law |9-11| and new york |12-15| is |16-16| $ 7.25 |17-18| per |19-19| hour . |20-21| 
fast food restaurants |0-2| to increase it |3-4| over time , |5-8| but very |9-10| little . |11-12| an average of |13-14| their |15-15| rank @-@ and @-@ file |16-16| employees |17-17| in new york |18-21| to earn |22-22| $ |24-24| 8.90 |23-23| per hour |25-26| . |27-27| 
no one |0-1| earns |2-2| less |3-3| in this |4-5| expensive |6-6| city . |7-8| 
i can &apos;t understand |0-3| how you can |4-6| survive |7-7| in new york |8-11| on this |12-13| money . |14-15| 
once upon a time |0-2| , almost |3-4| a quarter of |5-5| american teenagers |6-7| went through |8-9| mcdonald &apos;s |10-12| , working |13-14| part @-@ time |15-15| after school |16-17| , lives |18-19| with her parents |20-21| . |22-22| 
few people |0-1| saw |2-2| it |3-3| as a source of |4-5| life or |6-7| are planning |8-8| to stay |9-9| here |10-10| for a long time . |11-12| 
now i always |0-2| come through the |3-4| interview with |5-6| mcdonald &apos;s |7-9| employees |10-10| who |11-12| complain that |13-15| they have |16-17| to survive |18-18| on this |19-20| salary |21-21| , and sometimes even |22-25| to feed their |26-27| children . |28-29| 
on the other hand |0-2| , there is a |3-4| comment on |5-5| the wall street journal |6-9| of the forum |10-10| , whose |11-12| author |13-13| notes that |14-16| it is |17-17| irresponsible |18-18| to have |19-19| children , |20-21| if you |22-23| don &apos;t know how |24-27| you &apos;re going |28-29| to feed |30-30| them . |31-32| 
participants in the |0-0| protests |1-2| , which |3-4| began at |5-6| 6 : 30 a.m. |7-7| on thursday |8-9| near the |10-10| mcdonald &apos;s |11-13| on |14-14| the 40th |15-17| street and |18-19| madison avenue |20-21| demanded |22-22| cashiers |23-23| and |24-24| cooks |25-25| from |26-26| fast food |27-28| chain |29-29| paid |30-30| at least |31-33| $ 15 |34-35| per hour |36-37| , that is |38-40| twice that |41-44| today &apos;s |45-45| salary |46-46| . |47-47| 
they also |0-1| demanded |2-2| the creation of |3-3| trade unions |4-4| in the |5-5| fast @-@ food |7-8| industry |6-6| . |9-9| 
american |0-0| law prohibits |1-2| the administration |3-3| from |4-4| to prevent |5-6| or punish the |7-8| activists |9-9| of the trade union movement |10-11| through the |12-12| agonizing |13-13| or dismissal |14-15| . |16-16| 
on the other hand , |0-3| the administration does not |4-5| often |6-6| ease their |7-8| lives . |9-10| 
but |0-0| due to the |1-3| difficult to cover the |4-5| fast food |6-8| with the union |9-10| . |11-11| 
one of them is |0-3| unusual |4-4| turnover of |5-5| employees . |6-7| 
not |0-0| consistent |1-1| 
noisy |0-0| protests |1-1| began |2-2| on that day in |3-6| a number |7-7| of other |8-8| cheap |9-9| restaurants |10-10| in manhattan . |11-13| 
the highlight |0-0| of |1-1| the day |3-3| was |2-2| a rally |4-4| at the |5-5| mcdonald &apos;s |6-8| in times square |9-12| , where |13-14| several |15-15| local democratic |16-17| politicians |18-18| spoke out |19-19| . |20-20| one of them , |21-24| jumaane |25-25| williams |26-26| , said : &quot; |27-30| mcdonald &apos;s |31-33| claims that |34-36| he sells |37-38| billions of |39-39| portions |40-40| , |41-41| and , |42-43| despite this , |44-47| it doesn &apos;t even |48-50| give you a |51-52| hospital |53-53| or pay |54-55| you for |56-57| work |58-59| ! &quot; |60-61| 
the demonstrators |0-0| supported |1-1| other |2-2| prominent |3-3| new york |4-4| democrats , |5-6| like bill |7-8| de |9-9| blasio |10-10| , a |11-11| candidate for |12-14| mayor |15-15| of new york , |16-19| who said : &quot; |20-23| we need |24-25| the voice of |26-26| our joint commitment |27-29| of fast food |30-31| workers |32-32| , so they can |33-36| get |37-37| a fair |38-38| wages and |39-41| economic prosperity |42-43| that |44-45| every |46-46| resident |47-47| of new york |48-50| deserves |51-51| ! |52-52| . &quot; |53-54| 
according to the |0-1| new york times , |2-5| this was the largest |6-9| event |10-10| of its kind |11-12| in the history |13-14| of the american |15-15| fast @-@ food |16-18| industry . |19-20| 
but only |0-1| a few |2-2| hundred people |3-4| took part |5-6| in it |7-8| , and many of |9-12| them were not |13-15| fast @-@ food |16-18| employees , |19-20| who make up |21-22| tens of thousands of |23-24| people in |25-26| new york . |27-30| 
it is unclear whether |0-3| it is |4-4| now |5-5| spark |6-6| mass movement |7-8| . |9-9| 
&quot; at the moment |0-3| , the mind |4-5| can not |6-7| be deceived |8-9| too good |10-11| . &quot; |12-12| 
among the |0-0| modern technology |1-2| fans of the |3-3| popular topic |4-5| is |6-6| augmented reality |7-8| , lately |9-12| seen |13-13| primarily |14-15| through the prism of |16-17| special |18-18| glasses . |19-20| 
first , |0-3| the functional |4-4| model |5-5| was shown |6-7| by google |8-9| in the summer |10-10| at its |11-12| annual conference |13-14| . |15-15| then , |16-17| in november |18-19| , it was announced that |20-23| microsoft has |24-24| applied for |25-27| a patent |28-28| . |29-29| 
however , according to |0-3| talk |4-4| with the leader |5-6| of a group of |7-7| interactive |8-8| 3d |9-10| technologies |11-11| in cambridge |12-13| laboratory of |14-14| microsoft , |15-16| shahram |17-17| izadi |18-18| , glasses |19-20| - |21-21| the past |22-23| for scientists |24-25| in this |26-27| company . |28-29| 
they are |0-1| attracted by the |2-2| prospect of trying |3-3| to manipulate |4-4| virtual |5-5| objects |6-6| in the air |7-8| with their bare hands |9-10| , creating a |11-12| virtual |13-13| open spaces . |14-15| 
&quot; tell |0-1| them |2-3| , |4-4| simply put , |5-7| the work of |8-9| your |10-10| research group |11-12| . |13-13| 
&quot; we |0-1| are working on |2-3| the interaction |4-4| of people |5-5| with cars |6-7| , at the same |8-11| time trying to |12-14| expand |15-15| the boundaries |16-16| of this |17-17| interaction . |18-19| 
while the |0-3| general people |4-5| stuck |6-6| in working with the |7-9| pixels |10-10| on |11-11| a flat |12-12| screen and |13-14| sometimes |15-15| pointing to |16-17| them . |18-19| 
we want to |0-1| look at |2-3| 5 |4-4| @-@ 10 |5-6| years into the future |7-9| and |10-10| predict the |11-11| dramatic changes |12-13| in |14-14| this interaction |15-16| . |17-17| 
for example , |0-1| the xbox |2-2| and |3-3| kinect |4-4| sensors |5-5| , |6-6| is a step |7-9| forward . |10-11| almost |12-12| is not for sale |13-14| without the |15-15| xbox |16-16| kinect |17-17| today |18-18| because everyone |19-22| likes |23-23| to control |24-24| with |25-26| gestures |27-27| . |28-28| 
what else |1-2| is |0-0| waiting for |3-3| us in the future |4-6| ? |7-7| 
&quot; despite the fact |0-3| that the |4-5| kinect |6-6| moved |7-7| interaction |8-8| on a physical level |9-11| , |12-12| much still |13-14| occurs on |15-16| a flat screen |17-18| , sometimes |19-20| in 3d |21-22| . |23-23| 
the |1-1| information |0-0| has improved |2-2| ( system |3-4| gets more |5-6| data ) |7-8| , |9-9| but still |10-13| needs to |14-14| improve . |15-16| 
we are trying to |0-1| change that |2-3| by working |4-5| on |6-6| a |7-9| three @-@ dimensional |10-10| display |11-11| system , |12-13| based on |14-15| different technologies |16-17| , including |18-21| projection |22-22| technology . |23-24| 
we must |0-1| let the |2-2| computer world |3-4| in our |5-6| physical world |7-8| , make |9-10| it more |11-12| tangible . |13-14| 
but |0-0| for this |1-2| we need |3-4| to determine how |5-7| the user |8-8| and |9-9| the space |10-10| around him |11-12| . |13-13| 
then we can |0-2| complement the |3-3| real world |4-5| with virtual |6-7| objects in |8-9| a much more |10-11| convenient form |12-13| . |14-14| 
first of all , |0-2| to get rid |3-4| of these |5-5| stupid |6-6| virtual reality |7-8| helmets |9-9| ! |10-10| 
&quot; what |0-1| do you think about |2-4| the voice |5-5| control |6-6| ? |7-7| 
it is a very |0-1| popular |2-2| thing , |3-4| but it |5-6| overestimated |7-7| ? |8-8| 
&quot; it |0-1| certainly |2-2| is not a |3-4| cure |5-5| for all |6-7| - there is |8-9| the issue of |10-10| privacy , |11-12| because we don &apos;t |13-16| always |17-17| want to |18-18| let |19-19| others |20-20| know about |21-22| our actions |23-24| and intentions |25-26| . |27-27| 
in fact |0-1| , all |2-3| kinds of |4-4| interaction with |5-6| computers |7-7| are good , but |8-10| each |11-11| in its |12-13| niche . |14-15| 
for example |0-0| , we have a |1-4| project to |5-6| control |7-7| devices |8-8| in public places |9-11| where |12-14| we thought |15-16| about the |17-17| movements |18-18| , not |19-20| a broad |21-21| movement , |22-23| but |24-24| small |25-25| , |26-26| reserved . |27-28| 
the movement |0-0| was not |1-2| recorded |3-3| on camera |4-5| , but |6-7| on the |8-8| bracelet |9-10| that |11-12| identified the |13-13| movement of the |14-14| bones and |15-16| muscles . |17-18| 
this is a big |0-1| right now |2-3| , but |4-5| in theory |6-6| it |7-7| can be reduced to |8-11| the size of |12-13| the hands of |14-14| the clock |15-15| . |16-16| 
in general |0-1| , the future |2-3| lies at the heart |4-5| of the joint control |6-7| , for example , |8-10| the movement |11-11| + |12-12| voice . |13-14| 
&quot; what |0-1| do you mean ? |2-6| 
&quot; for example , |0-2| how would you |3-5| ask me |6-7| to give you this |8-12| a bottle of water |13-14| ? |15-15| 
you will |0-1| speak and |2-3| show |4-4| at the same time |5-8| . |9-9| 
&quot; |0-0| i usually |1-2| just |3-3| say |4-4| . |5-5| 
&quot; oh |0-1| , it will be |2-4| very difficult to |5-6| detect . |7-8| 
&quot; so |0-1| you want to make |2-4| users |5-5| to adapt |6-6| to what |7-10| the car |11-11| may or may not |12-15| do |16-16| at that moment ? |17-20| 
&quot; not |0-1| necessarily |2-2| , |3-3| but it is a |4-6| mutual |7-7| approach |8-8| . |9-9| 
i think that in |0-4| the near |5-5| future , |6-7| we will |8-9| mainly |10-11| work on |12-13| developing new |14-15| sensors |16-16| that allow |17-19| a more |20-20| precise definition of |21-22| human |23-23| reaction . |24-25| 
it may |0-1| be , for example |2-4| , laser |5-6| sensors |7-7| . |8-8| they have |9-10| a decent |11-11| depth of |12-12| resolution |13-13| , which |14-15| is very important . |16-19| 
&quot; if |0-1| we &apos;re talking about |2-4| your work |5-6| with the |7-7| xbox |8-8| kinect |9-9| sensors |10-10| , |11-11| what are your |12-13| complaints |14-14| on modern |15-16| cameras |17-17| ? |18-18| 
is not enough |0-0| resolution |1-1| , depth |2-3| or |4-4| something else |5-8| ? |9-9| 
&quot; in general , |0-3| the current generation |4-5| is that |6-10| we can |11-12| to base |13-13| themselves in |14-15| work on |16-17| three @-@ dimensional |18-18| recognition . |19-20| 
of course , |0-1| it would be good |2-4| to have |5-5| eight |6-6| megapixels |7-7| with |8-8| 1,000 |9-9| k |10-10| / s |11-12| speed . |13-14| 
it is not just |0-2| the mega |3-3| pixels |4-4| , though |5-6| , but |7-8| the quality |9-9| and |10-11| depth . |12-13| 
from this point of view |0-3| , all the |4-5| modern technology |6-7| is not good enough |8-10| for us |11-12| - it |13-14| adds |15-15| algorithm |16-17| designers . |18-19| 
therefore , |0-0| it is important to remember |1-2| about |3-4| the |5-5| x |6-6| , y |7-8| , z |9-10| . |11-11| 
the speed |0-0| , the number of |1-2| shots |3-3| per second |4-5| , is also very |6-8| important . |9-10| 
human |0-0| movements are |1-2| relatively |3-3| dynamics , |4-5| and |6-6| the current |7-7| 30 |8-8| k |9-9| / s |10-11| really |12-12| not enough |13-14| , especially for |15-17| gestures . |18-19| 
steven |0-0| bathiche |1-1| from our |2-3| redmond |4-4| lab |5-5| created a |6-6| touch |7-7| sensor |8-8| with adjustable |9-10| handle |11-11| reprieve |12-12| from 1 to |13-15| 100 |16-16| ms |17-17| , while |18-22| modern |23-23| serial |24-24| sensors |25-25| closer to |26-27| the latest |28-28| indicator |29-29| ( 60 |30-31| @-@ 100 |32-33| ) . |34-35| 
not everyone understands |0-3| how it |4-5| affects the |6-7| interaction |8-8| between man and |9-11| machine . |12-13| 
in |0-0| my work |1-2| , it would be |3-5| very useful |6-7| to have |8-8| a device that |9-11| does not require |12-13| touching |14-14| and will |15-16| have more |17-18| shots |19-19| in the |20-20| second . |21-22| 
- |0-0| does |1-2| the number of |3-3| cameras |4-4| should |5-5| be increased |6-7| ? |8-8| 
the |0-1| kinect |2-2| there are |3-3| three cameras |4-5| now |6-6| , one of which |7-10| is actually an |11-14| infrared emitter |15-16| , and |17-17| second |18-18| , the recipient |19-20| of the signal |21-21| . |22-22| 
the third |0-0| is |1-1| actually |2-4| a regular |5-5| sensor |6-6| the visible |7-7| range . |8-9| 
it |0-0| does not apply |1-2| to determine the |3-4| object |5-5| of depth |6-6| . |7-7| 
potentially , |0-1| a large number of |2-3| cameras |4-4| could |5-6| solve the problem |7-8| ... |9-9| 
or |0-0| make it |1-2| worse |3-4| by increasing |5-6| the required |7-7| amount of |8-8| payments . |9-10| 
it would be nice |0-2| to create |3-3| flexible |4-4| analogue |5-5| kinect |6-6| , |7-7| playing with |8-9| comes from |10-11| the camera |12-12| , |13-13| dormitories |14-14| and see how |15-18| it will help |19-20| in |21-21| three @-@ dimensional |22-22| definition of the position |23-25| . |26-26| 
&quot; as far as |0-1| i remember |2-3| , microsoft |4-5| does not |6-6| represent their |7-8| glasses |9-9| to |10-11| the public |12-12| , unlike |13-16| google . |17-18| 
don &apos;t you think |0-3| it is one of |4-6| the most promising |7-8| areas |9-9| in terms of |10-12| everyday use |13-14| augmented reality |16-17| technology |15-15| ? |18-18| 
&quot; of course |0-1| , it is not |2-4| very convenient |5-6| to walk with |7-8| a smartphone |9-9| in your |10-11| raised their hands |12-13| all the time |14-15| , but |16-17| i think that the |18-21| best option |22-23| would be a &quot; |24-25| transitional |26-26| &quot; |27-27| augmented reality |28-29| , where |30-31| you could |32-34| shift from |35-36| glasses for |37-38| smartphones , |39-40| the projection |41-41| screen , |42-43| and everywhere |44-45| , based on the |46-48| cloud |49-49| platform . |50-51| 
points |0-0| are very |1-2| personal |3-3| devices , |4-5| that is |6-7| their strength |8-9| ( |10-10| personal belongings |11-12| only see |13-14| you |15-15| ) |16-16| and , |17-18| at the same time |19-22| , their |23-24| weakness |25-25| is |26-26| augmented reality |27-28| , based on the |29-31| glasses |32-32| will not allow |33-34| you to work |35-36| with virtual |37-38| objects |39-39| , together |40-40| with other people . |41-44| 
&quot; |0-0| let &apos;s imagine |1-2| for a moment that |3-6| manipulation |7-7| of virtual |8-8| holographic |9-9| objects |10-10| in the air |11-12| is available |13-13| not only to |14-16| tony |17-17| stark |18-18| of the |19-19| ironman |20-20| , but for the |21-23| common man . |24-26| 
there is one |0-1| problem with |2-3| this idea |4-5| that |6-7| critics often |8-9| point |10-10| : no |11-12| tactile |13-13| feedback |14-15| . |16-16| 
hands |0-0| himself |1-1| nothing ! |2-3| 
what answers |0-1| your group |2-3| to prepare for |4-5| this |6-6| problem ? |7-8| 
- |0-0| in his |1-2| lecture , |3-3| i often say that |4-8| augmented reality |9-10| - |11-11| the seventh |12-12| consecutive |13-13| attempt |14-14| the interaction |15-15| between man and |16-18| machine . |19-20| 
i think |0-3| the eighth |4-4| is likely to be |5-8| adding |9-9| tactile |10-10| sensations . |11-12| 
at the moment , |0-3| one of the most interesting |4-7| tricks |8-8| is to use |9-10| the second |11-11| hand |12-12| as a kind of |13-15| matrix |16-16| image . |17-18| 
it is great |0-1| when registering |2-3| pushes |4-4| ! |5-5| 
but there are |0-1| technologies that |2-4| really |5-5| aimed to |6-10| these &quot; |11-12| pictures |13-13| in the air |14-15| , &quot; |16-16| a sense of |17-17| tangibility |18-18| , for example , |19-21| the intervention of |22-22| a number of targeted |23-24| ultrasound |25-25| beams |26-26| to a certain |27-28| point where the |29-31| finger |32-32| is |33-33| gives |34-34| a sensation |35-35| , but |36-37| very weak |38-39| right now |40-41| , as if |42-45| someone |46-48| blew |49-49| on the |50-50| web site . |51-54| 
there are also |0-1| watches |2-2| bracelets |3-3| that affect |4-7| nerve |8-8| endings |9-9| in |10-10| his fingers |11-11| , who is also |12-15| the promising |16-17| . |18-18| 
&quot; you |0-1| tried |2-2| to trick |3-3| the brain |4-4| ? |5-5| 
to make |0-0| her |1-1| think he |2-5| feels |6-7| something that |8-12| it must |13-14| be |15-15| feeling |16-16| when |17-18| he sees |19-20| something ? |21-24| 
&quot; |0-0| it is |1-1| a good idea , |2-4| and |5-5| we have not tried |6-8| it |9-9| yet . |10-11| 
it hides |0-1| one problem |2-3| that |4-5| cannot be |6-7| solved |8-8| so quickly |9-10| - how |11-12| to make |13-13| a man who |14-16| is physically |17-18| very limited |19-22| to believe that |23-25| he is going |26-27| to |28-28| open , |29-30| virtually limitless |31-32| space |33-33| ; |34-34| we are working on |35-37| the concept of |38-38| treadmills |39-40| ( |41-41| generally |42-42| do not like |43-44| at clubs |45-46| ) , |47-48| moving |49-49| platforms , |50-51| and |52-52| giant |53-53| balloons |54-54| . |55-55| 
so far , |0-2| deceiving |3-3| the brain |4-4| has |5-5| limited |6-6| success , |7-8| there is |9-9| work |10-10| for many years to come |11-14| . |15-15| 
this is |0-0| what makes |1-4| the work |5-5| on the |6-6| virtual reality |7-8| so |9-9| attractive to |10-11| researchers |12-12| - many |13-14| things |15-15| in their |16-17| beginnings . |18-19|

a new player |0-1| in &quot; |2-3| rosbalt |4-4| &quot; - |5-6| a courageous |7-7| artist |8-8| cyril |9-9| miller |10-10| . |11-11| 
the whole |0-0| town |1-1| knows , |2-3| cyril |4-4| miller |5-5| , a |6-6| bearded |7-7| man |8-8| dressed |9-9| in red |10-11| , which |12-13| you can see the |14-15| russian museum |16-17| , or |18-19| by the summer |20-21| garden , |22-23| or |24-24| on the |25-25| fashionable |26-26| parties and |27-28| concerts . |29-30| 
cyril |0-0| miller &apos;s work |1-2| always brings |3-4| in |5-5| the crowds |6-6| of people |7-7| , |8-8| regardless of |9-12| where they |13-14| were |15-15| . |16-16| 
cyril |0-0| miller |1-1| is one of the |2-4| purely |5-5| st. petersburg |6-8| social and |9-10| philosophical |11-11| storytellers |12-12| and the creators |13-14| of a new |15-15| mythology . |16-17| 
cyril |0-0| miller |1-1| is an outstanding |2-3| person |4-4| of the st. petersburg |5-7| avant @-@ garde |8-8| in the late 1980s |9-12| and early |13-14| 1990s |15-17| . |18-18| 
in addition , he |0-3| is |4-4| a city |5-6| person who |7-9| makes people |10-11| smile |12-12| on the street and |13-15| raises |16-16| up |17-17| universal |18-18| spirit . |19-20| 
he recently |0-1| took |2-2| up the |3-4| street |5-5| organ music |6-7| and became |8-9| st. |10-11| petersburg |12-12| man |13-13| because he |14-17| was |18-18| ready for |19-20| this complex |21-22| role |23-23| with all |24-25| his |26-26| bohemian |27-27| life , |28-29| philosophy and |30-31| image . |32-33| 
- |0-0| cyril |1-1| , |2-2| why did you |3-4| walk |5-5| around the city |6-7| all in |8-9| red |10-10| , yellow |11-12| or |13-13| turquoise |14-14| , |15-15| for example |16-16| ? |17-17| 
&quot; i |0-1| chose the |2-2| red |3-4| as a designer |5-7| is engaged in |8-8| appearance and |9-11| image . |12-13| 
in this world , |0-3| red - |4-5| a compromise |6-6| between the |7-7| artist , |8-9| image @-@ |10-11| maker |12-12| and society |13-14| . |15-15| 
although |0-0| in society |1-2| , all that is |3-6| not |7-7| gray |8-8| causes |9-9| aggression and |10-11| canvassing |12-12| in |13-13| bad |14-14| shape . |15-16| 
but my |0-1| provocations |2-2| aimed at |3-4| starting |5-5| a conversation |6-6| . |7-7| 
the whole history |0-1| of my |2-2| provocative actions |3-4| is |5-6| an invitation |7-7| to |8-8| debate . |9-10| 
&quot; when |0-1| you |2-2| realize that |3-5| you have to be |6-8| an artist |9-9| ? |10-10| 
&quot; |0-0| the exhibition in |1-3| the |4-4| house of culture |5-6| , where |7-8| my work |9-10| was shown |11-12| . |13-13| 
it became clear to me |0-2| that this is |3-5| my way |6-7| . |8-8| 
then |0-0| a wave of |1-1| senior |2-2| free , |3-4| informal |5-5| artists |6-6| went , |7-8| while the |9-12| new |13-13| , free |14-15| artists |16-16| like me |17-18| don &apos;t |19-19| understand . |20-21| 
i became friends |0-1| with artists |2-3| new wave |4-5| , with |6-7| a post @-@ |8-9| gaza |10-10| @-@ |11-11| nevsky |12-12| style |13-13| artists |14-14| ( &quot; |15-16| post @-@ |17-18| gazonevschina |19-19| &quot; ) |20-21| , which led to |22-25| pushkinskaya |26-26| 10 |27-28| , and |29-30| there was no longer |32-34| a wave |31-31| . |35-35| 
i brought |0-1| in a theater |2-3| , clothes |4-5| , music |6-7| , all |8-9| genres , |10-11| except in |12-12| literature . |13-14| 
&quot; and it &apos;s all |0-3| were united |4-5| in their |6-7| art @-@ |8-9| clinic |10-10| ... - |11-12| it was important for me |13-16| to find |17-19| themselves |20-20| at the center of the |21-22| culture |23-23| of st. petersburg |24-26| , where |27-28| all |29-29| the best |30-30| creative forces |31-32| must unite |33-34| . |35-35| 
in 1995 |0-2| i |3-3| occupied territories |4-5| on pushkin |6-7| @-@ 10 |8-9| , and |10-11| although the |12-12| repair work |13-14| has not yet |15-16| begun , |17-18| was |19-19| a musical |20-20| and creative |21-22| club , |23-24| a bohemian |25-25| club |26-27| house |28-28| in st. petersburg |29-32| in the czech republic . |33-34| 
many |0-0| were born |1-1| here : |2-3| nomy |4-4| , |5-5| tequila |6-6| jazz , |7-8| i remember when |9-12| then was |13-14| delivered there |15-16| with |17-17| van gogh |18-19| &apos;s ear |20-20| project . |21-22| 
then , |0-0| and his friends |1-3| lip |4-4| simple |5-5| sang songs |6-7| , |8-8| wearing tight |9-10| leotards |11-11| and now |12-14| fashionable |15-15| composer |16-16| igor |17-17| vdovin |18-18| was with |19-20| them . |21-22| 
when |0-0| the band |1-1| started playing |2-3| live , |4-5| was the |6-6| leningrad . |7-8| 
trakhtenberg |0-0| was |1-1| leading |2-2| many |3-3| programs |4-4| before the |5-5| hali |6-6| @-@ |7-7| ghali |8-8| times . |9-10| 
we |0-0| gave them |1-2| trakhtenberg |3-3| , and |4-5| a great |6-6| career was |7-8| on its way |9-11| , but the |12-13| basic education |14-15| and mentoring |16-17| he received |18-19| from us . |20-22| 
the gallery |0-0| d |1-1| 137 , |2-3| griboedov |4-4| , |5-5| club - |6-7| all this |8-9| echo of |10-10| art @-@ |11-12| clinic . |13-14| 
that &apos;s where |0-1| our employees |2-3| and left |4-5| for regular customers . |6-9| 
i am a |0-1| hero of the |2-2| last century |3-4| , when |5-6| the culture |7-7| meant |8-8| something |9-9| . |10-10| 
in 2000 , |0-3| was |4-4| a poll |5-5| in the press , |6-8| for the people |9-10| of our city . |11-13| 
i was |0-1| nominated for |2-2| artist , |3-4| culminate |5-6| came to an end |7-9| . |10-10| 
in |0-0| the new |1-2| times , |3-4| it is |5-5| inconvenient |6-6| to work |7-7| under the |8-8| old rules |9-10| . &quot; |11-11| i am |12-12| a man |13-13| of truth |14-14| , honesty |15-16| and culture |17-18| of the last |19-19| century . |20-21| 
nowadays |0-2| , it is easy |3-4| to become |5-5| popular , |6-7| but the |8-8| culture and |9-10| the popularity of |11-11| different . |12-13| you can |14-15| be |16-16| popular |17-17| , but |18-19| not very |20-21| culturally |22-22| . |23-23| 
&quot; your |0-1| work is |2-2| marked by |3-3| its |4-4| recognizable |5-5| style . |6-7| 
&quot; |0-0| many of my |1-3| works |4-4| are |5-5| hits |6-6| , |7-7| with clearly |8-9| reflects |10-10| the importance |11-11| and |12-12| the poignancy |13-13| of vision |14-14| . |15-15| 
i will |0-1| have a |2-2| program of the |3-3| exhibit |4-4| , |5-5| &quot; the russian museum |6-8| in the |9-9| clowns |10-10| . &quot; |11-12| 
clowns |0-0| - |1-1| the eternal |2-2| category . |3-4| 
i was |0-1| social and |2-3| before , |4-5| now |6-6| it is |7-7| painful |8-8| and scary |9-10| . |11-13| 
but all |0-1| dilute |2-2| the |3-3| clowns , |4-5| the tragedy |6-6| is removed |7-7| . |8-8| 
i love the |0-1| grotesque |2-2| , i |3-4| ???????? |5-5| ideas . |6-7| 
for example , |0-1| saving |2-2| the world |3-3| with the help of a |4-5| totalitarian |6-6| to change clothes |7-8| on order |9-10| . |11-11| 
nowadays , people |0-3| are judged |4-4| by appearance |5-7| , not their |8-11| internal qualities |12-13| . |14-14| 
who knows |0-1| , maybe |2-5| you can &apos;t |6-8| shake |9-9| his hand |10-11| , and |12-13| need to |14-14| spit |15-15| in the face . |16-18| 
but |0-0| the lies |1-1| will disappear |2-2| with the help of a |3-4| changing |5-5| clothes . |6-7| 
&quot; |0-0| recently |1-1| we have seen |2-3| you in |4-5| the role of the |6-6| music |7-7| man . |8-9| - |10-10| cultural |11-11| city |12-12| should have |13-14| such a |15-15| character . |16-17| 
anyone who |0-0| fits |1-1| the |2-2| role |3-3| better than i |4-7| ? |8-8| 
- |0-0| may be |1-2| , commercial |3-4| art |5-5| can also be |6-8| beautiful |9-9| ? |10-10| 
&quot; today |0-1| , commercial |2-3| art should |4-5| be careful |6-7| and considerate |8-9| , sweet |10-11| . |12-12| 
is the |0-0| disintegration of |1-1| cultures . |2-3| 
people used to |0-1| gather in |2-3| the pack |4-4| , czechs |5-6| loved |7-7| one thing |8-9| , |10-10| ordinary people |11-12| , something |13-16| else . |17-18| 
now everyone |0-1| is divided into |2-3| micro |4-4| societies , |5-6| it is difficult to be |7-8| everyone . |9-10| 
i &apos;m not |0-1| one hundred |2-2| dollar |3-3| to |4-5| please everyone |6-7| . |8-8| 
now you |0-1| must think |2-3| of who |4-5| will you |6-7| please . |8-9| 
now , |0-1| every |2-2| cult |3-3| hero |4-4| has |5-5| 100 |6-6| fans . |7-8| 
&quot; but |0-1| a few thousand |2-3| come to |4-5| stas mihaylov |6-7| ! |8-8| 
- |0-0| the actors |1-1| @-@ |2-2| outs |3-3| to go |4-4| to him |5-6| , the sexual |7-8| @-@ |9-9| social |10-11| work |12-12| there . |13-14| 
but the |0-0| 300 people |1-2| will come |3-3| to the |4-4| culture |5-5| , not |6-8| 10,000 |9-9| . |10-10| in the end , |11-14| there are less |15-16| management , |17-18| money , |19-20| all the |21-21| expiring . |22-23| 
i have |0-2| fans , |3-4| the main thing is |5-6| not to make |7-8| them |9-9| so as not to |10-12| spoil |13-13| what i |14-17| earned |18-18| . |19-19| 
in |0-0| my youth |1-2| , |3-3| i drew |4-5| such |6-6| art |7-7| that one |8-10| collector |11-11| was |12-12| he |13-13| hangs |14-14| on one |15-16| wall |17-17| with |18-18| falk |19-19| and |20-20| larionov |21-21| . |22-22| 
i started |0-1| with the |2-2| paintings |3-3| that |4-5| people usually |6-7| end . |8-9| 
the concept |0-0| often confused |1-2| these days |3-5| . |6-6| 
people say |0-1| : |2-2| the spiritual |3-3| culture , |4-5| a culture |6-6| of consumption |7-7| . |8-8| 
there is no culture of |0-1| consumption , |2-3| it is |4-4| &quot; |5-5| from another |6-7| opera |8-8| . &quot; |9-10| 
i |0-0| am a |1-1| man |2-2| of yesterday &apos;s |3-3| culture . |4-5| &quot; i |6-6| grew up |7-7| on the |8-8| examples |9-9| of artists |10-10| who lived |11-13| in poor |14-14| and died |15-16| in poverty |17-18| , refused |19-20| the money |21-21| for the sake of the |22-22| painting . |23-24| 
it &apos;s |0-0| a culture |1-1| , i &apos;m |2-3| for |4-4| . |5-5| 
- |0-0| cyril |1-1| that saint @-@ petersburg |2-6| lacks |7-8| ? |9-9| 
&quot; good |0-1| cultural |2-2| experts . |3-4| 
there is |0-0| such a thing |1-2| : |3-3| the official |4-4| for |5-5| culture . |6-7| 
but not |0-1| everyone can |2-3| be involved in the |4-6| culture . |7-8| 
with proper |0-1| rulers |2-2| was different |3-7| . |8-8| kings , |9-10| perhaps |11-12| not very well |13-15| understood the |16-16| culture , |17-18| but |19-19| they realized |20-23| they need |24-25| to stick to |26-26| the right |27-27| experts . |28-29| 
there are good |0-1| consultants |2-2| in moscow |3-4| right now |5-6| . |7-7| 
here in |0-2| st. petersburg , |3-6| there are people who |7-10| could |11-12| be experts |13-14| , but they are |15-17| on the sidelines |18-19| because |20-22| we need |26-26| more advanced |23-24| specialists |25-25| who will |27-29| assess correctly |30-31| , these |32-32| experts and |33-34| give |35-35| them |36-36| . |37-37| 
judgment |0-0| is that |1-4| now |5-5| thrive . |6-7| 
even |0-0| erart |1-1| , but |2-3| they &apos;re all different |4-6| because they |7-10| honestly |11-11| say that |12-14| we do not accept |15-17| all of |18-18| modern art |19-20| . &quot; |21-21| there are some |22-23| artists |24-24| who |25-26| need to find |27-28| other museums |29-30| for themselves |31-32| . |33-33| 
that the |0-1| st. petersburg |2-4| mean to you ? |5-8| 
&quot; st. petersburg |0-3| is not a |4-5| cultural capital |6-7| , moscow |8-9| has |10-10| much more |11-12| culture , |13-14| there is a |15-15| bedrock |16-16| there . |17-18| 
it is |0-0| difficult for |1-2| art |3-3| to grow |4-4| on our |5-6| rocks . |7-8| 
we must |0-1| cultural |2-2| bedrock |3-3| , but |4-5| we now have |6-9| more than |10-12| readers |13-13| and writers |14-15| . &quot; |16-16| it is wrong . |17-19| 
in europe |0-1| , there are |2-3| a lot of |4-4| curious |5-5| people who |6-8| go to |9-10| art exhibitions |11-12| , |13-13| concerts . |14-15| 
here , |0-1| this layer |2-3| is |4-5| a thin |6-6| . |7-7| 
we must |0-1| make |2-2| the art of |3-3| fashion |4-4| , as it was |5-8| at the beginning |9-10| of the last |11-11| century . |12-13| 
the project |0-0| is being implemented |1-1| with the support |2-3| of st. petersburg . |4-7| 
bear |0-0| in space |1-2| 
the earth |0-0| is in |1-2| danger . |3-4| 
global warming |0-1| or |2-2| difficulties |3-3| with a |4-4| killer |5-5| asteroid |6-6| . |7-7| 
caravans |0-0| of spacecraft |1-2| with people |3-4| on board |5-6| to |7-8| search for a |9-9| replacement |10-10| of the planet |11-11| . |12-12| 
to save |0-1| humanity , |2-3| the question |4-4| is to |5-9| promote |10-10| our |11-11| race |12-12| in conditions of |13-14| weightlessness |15-15| or |16-16| the replacement |17-18| of the planet |19-19| ? |20-20| 
i think that |0-3| the choice |4-4| is small . |5-6| 
there are |0-0| only two |1-2| real |3-3| planets |4-4| that can be |5-8| investigated |9-9| , even |10-10| hypothetically |11-11| . |12-12| 
&quot; |0-0| venus |1-1| and mars |2-3| , &quot; says |4-7| a senior fellow at the |8-10| institute of astronomy |11-12| p.k. |13-13| shternberg |14-14| state ( |15-16| gaish |17-17| ) |18-18| vladimir |19-19| surdin |20-20| . |21-21| 
but |0-0| while the |1-4| conditions |5-5| on mars |6-7| , |8-8| more suitable |9-10| for life |11-12| , venus |13-14| has |15-15| 500 |16-16| degrees |17-17| the temperature |18-18| . |19-19| 
life is possible |0-1| only at |2-3| high altitude |4-5| or |6-6| on the |7-7| orbit |8-8| of venus |9-9| ... |10-10| in space |11-12| . |13-13| 
the question |0-0| of reproduction |1-1| in space |2-3| began with |4-5| flora . |6-7| 
half a century |0-0| ago , |1-2| the experiments were conducted |3-4| at plants |5-6| . |7-7| 
four |0-0| generations of |1-1| peas |2-2| grew up |3-3| in orbit |4-5| the earth |6-6| were not |7-8| different from |9-10| their peers |11-12| . |13-13| 
then |0-0| , the |1-1| insects |2-2| were |3-3| withdrawn |4-4| into orbit |5-6| , small |7-8| fruit flies |9-9| . |10-10| 
in 1979 , |0-3| quail eggs |4-5| were sent |6-7| into space |8-9| to see |10-13| how |14-14| embryos |15-15| develop |16-16| in |17-17| weightlessness |18-18| . |19-19| 
we get |0-1| an absolutely normal |2-3| chick |4-4| . |5-5| 
but then |0-1| the problem |2-2| begins . |3-4| 
&quot; the problem |0-1| is that |2-6| it is a |7-7| chicken |8-8| needs to find |9-10| support , |11-12| we need |13-13| to get back on its |14-15| feet and |16-17| start moving |18-19| , &quot; |20-22| explains the |23-23| head of the laboratory of |24-25| the institute for biomedical |26-29| problems ( |30-31| imbp |32-32| ) |33-33| vladimir |35-35| wounds |34-34| after |36-36| . |37-37| 
not finding |0-1| support , |2-3| the chickens |4-4| were |5-5| to fall |6-6| around the |7-8| disorder . |9-10| 
after |0-0| 10 hours |1-2| , newborn |3-4| experienced |5-5| full |6-6| atrophy |7-7| instincts . |8-9| 
the chicks |0-0| not |1-1| react to |2-3| light and |4-5| sound . |6-7| 
and |0-0| the problem |1-1| was that |2-6| they just |7-8| died |9-9| after four |10-11| days . |12-13| 
&quot; we |0-1| bred |2-2| chickens |3-3| twice |4-4| there , |5-6| then stalled |7-9| , because |10-12| it is impossible |13-13| to work |14-14| with them |15-16| , &quot; says vladimir |17-21| after |22-22| the |23-24| failure |25-25| of an experiment |26-26| with |27-27| chickens |28-28| in space |29-30| . |31-31| 
the last |0-0| of the biological |1-1| &quot; mini |2-3| @-@ |4-4| ark |5-6| with animals |7-8| flew |9-9| into orbit |10-11| 16 years |12-13| ago . |14-15| 
in the spring |0-0| of 2013 |1-2| , experiments |3-4| will continue |5-6| . |7-7| 
however , |0-0| only |1-1| same @-@ sex |2-2| creatures |3-3| will be |4-4| on the |5-5| bion |6-6| bio @-@ |7-8| satellite . |9-10| 
there was |0-1| an experiment |2-2| on |3-3| rats |4-4| that were |5-7| sent |8-8| into space |9-10| with the |11-11| fetus . |12-13| 
in principle , |0-2| there was nothing |3-5| extraordinary |6-6| there . |7-8| 
&quot; it was |0-2| on the |3-3| bio @-@ |4-5| satellites , |6-7| but again , |8-11| it was a unique |12-14| experiment |15-15| and |16-16| such research |17-18| should be conducted |19-20| , &quot; says vladimir |21-25| passes |26-26| . |27-27| 
after landing |0-1| , the |2-2| space |3-3| rats |4-4| in infants |5-6| . |7-7| 
but it is hard to |0-1| solve the problem |2-3| of reproduction |4-4| directly into |5-6| space . |7-8| 
it is not |0-1| an easy task . |2-4| 
the animals |0-0| simply cannot |1-3| follow |4-4| their |5-5| sexual |6-6| instinct |7-7| when they are |8-10| out of their |11-12| usual |13-13| environment . |14-15| 
in principle |0-1| , people |2-3| , unlike |4-7| animals , |8-9| may |10-10| . |11-11| 
homo |0-0| sapiens |1-1| have |2-2| abstract |3-3| thinking , |4-5| and |6-6| are able |7-7| to create |8-8| a decent |9-9| emotional |10-10| background . |11-12| 
such |0-0| experiments |1-1| were not |2-3| on ethical |4-5| grounds . |6-7| 
but the |0-0| women were |1-2| to fly |3-3| into space |4-5| for 50 years |6-9| . |10-10| 
the biggest risk |0-2| was for |3-4| tereshkova |5-5| . |6-6| 
the most valuable |0-1| for mankind |2-3| - |4-4| the female body |5-6| . |7-7| 
our &quot; |0-1| seagull |2-2| &quot; |3-3| left , |4-5| and no one can |6-9| say |10-10| whether |11-13| it will be |14-15| ok |16-16| after the flight |17-18| into space |19-20| . |21-21| 
whether |0-0| it will be able |1-2| to give birth to |3-3| a child |4-5| after this |6-7| flight . |8-9| 
&quot; no one |0-2| answered this question |3-6| , &quot; says |7-10| veteran of |11-11| the rocket and space |12-14| industry , |15-16| vakhtang |17-17| vachnadze |18-18| . |19-19| 
in june |0-1| 1964 |2-3| , |4-4| just one year after |5-8| the flight |9-9| into space |10-11| , |12-12| the first woman |13-14| in space |15-16| , valentina |17-17| tereshkova |18-18| gave birth to |19-19| a daughter . |20-21| 
the father |0-0| of the child , |1-2| faust |3-3| nikolaev , |4-5| also |6-6| was a |7-7| cosmonaut |8-8| . |9-9| 
in 1988 , |0-3| the second |4-4| woman |5-6| cosmonaut |7-7| , svetlana |8-9| savitskaya |10-10| , who |11-12| went |13-13| into orbit |14-15| twice |16-16| and even |17-18| worked |19-19| in an open |20-21| space , |22-23| gave birth to a |24-24| son . |25-26| 
however , |0-1| the risk |2-2| remains . |3-4| 
we have a few |0-3| very few |4-5| astronauts |6-6| who |7-8| were in |9-10| order and |11-12| healthy children |13-14| after long |15-16| flights |17-17| . |18-18| 
&quot; |0-0| moreover , |1-3| it is dangerous |4-4| even for |5-6| orbital |7-7| flights |8-8| , &quot; adds |9-12| cosmonaut |13-15| , hero |16-17| of the soviet |18-18| union , |19-20| the hero |21-21| of russia , |22-23| valery |24-24| polyakov . |25-26| 
and yet , |0-3| humanity |4-4| needs to |5-5| look for |6-6| new ways |7-8| in biotechnology |9-10| , protection from |11-13| radiation , |14-15| creating |16-16| artificial |17-17| gravity . |18-19| 
hydro @-@ |0-1| lab |2-2| cfc |3-3| - |4-4| phase |5-6| of preparation for the |7-8| flight . |9-10| 
here |0-0| , the |1-1| astronauts |2-2| practice |3-3| skills |4-5| in an open |6-7| space |8-8| in |9-10| zero @-@ |11-11| gravity . |12-13| 
the water |0-0| simulates |1-1| weightlessness |2-2| . |3-3| 
if |0-0| for adults |1-2| , the water |3-3| is the |4-4| external environment |5-6| , although |7-8| comfortable |9-10| for babies |11-12| is a |13-13| native |14-14| of elements . |15-16| 
small |0-0| amphibians |1-1| seem to |2-4| confirm |5-5| that life |6-8| came |9-9| to earth |10-11| from the |12-12| ocean . |13-14| 
in connection |0-1| with the fact that |2-5| the infant |6-6| spends |7-7| about nine |8-9| months |10-11| as |12-12| fluid in |13-14| the womb |15-16| ; |17-17| it is easier |18-18| to get used to |19-20| the water |21-21| after that |22-23| . |24-24| 
in principle , |0-2| it is |3-3| logical because |4-7| only |8-8| two weeks |9-10| to go |11-11| from birth to |12-14| the first |15-15| swimming . |16-17| 
&quot; it &apos;s |0-1| very little |2-3| time to |4-6| forget |7-7| something |8-10| , &quot; says |11-14| children &apos;s |15-15| swimming |16-16| instructor |17-17| marina |18-18| aksyonova |19-19| . |20-20| 
in other words , |0-2| if the |3-4| newborn |5-5| weightlessness |6-6| is a |7-7| more natural |8-9| , |10-10| a woman should |11-12| gravity , |13-14| gravity ) |15-16| . |17-17| 
abdominal |0-0| and |1-1| pelvic muscles |2-3| usually |4-4| quickly |5-5| degenerate into |6-7| weightlessness |8-8| ; |9-9| the ability to |10-10| push |11-11| the embryo |12-12| is declining |13-13| . |14-14| 
well , |0-1| let &apos;s say that |2-4| childbirth |5-5| stimulants |6-6| will work |7-8| . |9-9| 
maybe |0-2| it will |3-4| push |5-5| the child |6-6| in a special |7-8| room . |9-10| 
&quot; then |0-1| what ? |2-3| &quot; asks |4-6| valery |7-7| polyakov |8-8| about this |9-10| trivial task . |11-13| 
on the other hand |0-2| , the child |3-4| also |5-5| needs |6-7| an artificial |8-8| gravity . |9-10| 
when the body |0-1| does not feel |2-3| the pull |5-5| of the earth |4-4| , it is not |6-8| a form of |9-9| bone |10-10| and muscle |11-12| system . |13-14| 
it is impossible |0-0| to |1-2| dress |3-3| a newborn |4-4| in orbit |5-6| in |7-7| a special |8-8| costume for |9-10| loading |11-11| of training |12-12| , as |13-14| they do |15-16| with adults |17-18| . |19-19| 
it will |0-1| simply |2-2| not what |3-6| he wants |7-8| to survive . |9-12| 
&quot; and |0-1| this experiment |2-3| that |4-5| we will go |6-7| on |8-8| , allowing |9-10| the birth |11-11| of a child |12-12| in a foreign |13-14| environment , |15-16| will lead to the |17-18| us |19-19| , bringing |20-21| a disability |22-22| , completely |23-24| unadapted |25-25| man |26-26| on earth |27-28| , &quot; |29-31| predicts |32-32| the chairman of the committee |33-34| on bioethics |35-36| imbp |37-37| ran |38-38| igor |39-39| ?????? |40-40| . |41-41| 
at the moment , |0-3| the birth |4-4| of children |5-5| in space |6-7| is |8-9| only a |10-10| theory . |11-12| 
but over time , |0-2| it will become |3-4| a reality |5-5| , when |6-7| earthlings |8-9| will go |10-10| on a |11-11| distant |12-12| planet |13-13| in their |14-15| ships , |16-17| and she |18-19| will be home to |20-22| their children |23-24| , who |25-26| were born |27-27| in space |28-29| . |30-30|
