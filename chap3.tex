\chapter{Design and implementation}

In previous chapter, we introduced Computer Aided Translation, discussing how multiple assistance ways provided within systems implementing this concept  relate to our novel tool that aims to support translators by providing an ability to fix specified parts of the translation using paraphrasing options. Furthermore, we discussed previous paraphrasing approaches highlighting similarities and difference with technique we use to search paraphrases. And finally a brief overview of phrase-based Statistical Machine Translation was provided to introduce origins of the search graph, data structure that we use as main source for paraphrasing.

Current chapter will provide detailed description of work that was carried out during this project. We start by analysing requirements for paraphrasing service within a CAT system. After that an iterational design and implementation process we applied to develop working version of such service. Major design decision that were made during the work on project will be introduced and justified. 

\section{Analysing requirements}

As mentioned earlier, an essential aspect of our paraphrasing approach is that it aims to provide a real-time targeted paraphrase search. Unlike previous efforts discussed by us before, we consider an interactive environment were queries sent by users are executed against our data model and results after being dynamically filtered and ranked using various heuristics are returned to user interface. In this section we list main requirements for our approach that were considered during design stage.

\textbf{Integration with existing CAT software}. Taking into account that most of modern CAT implementations are providing web based service (Caitra, Casmacat, MateCat), we also employed the client-server architecture to design our paraphrasing service. It might be easily attached as a module to the services provided online. Moreover, our service could also be hosted as a standalone service and integrated with desktop translation software by providing an API. This way our paraphrasing assistance might be accessible from all major types of CAT applications.

\textbf{Reusing results of machine translation}. Another important feature of our paraphrasing system is being able to produce paraphrases using only data available as a result of machine translation that provides post-editing assistance, rather requiring any additional paraphrase corpora. We designed our implementation to support translation output generated by Moses []. The process of retrieving and processing search graph will be reviewed by us in [section 3.2].

\textbf{Importance of ranking}. Quality of final ranking of the paraphrasing options is crucial requirement for RePhraser that aims to provide an interactive service. Indeed, basic concepts of Human-Computer Interaction suggest that paraphrasing options displayed to users will be efficient only in case if there count doesn't exceed 7. This means that it's important to rank top results in a way that they will contain at least one good paraphrase. Features that we exploited for ranking as well as a dynamic system of filters and sorters that we applied to improve top results will be described in [section 3.5].  


\textbf{Paraphrasing granularity}. Various levels of paraphrase granularity are studied. In case of entire sentences the task is known \textit{sentential} (or \textit{clausal}) paraphrasing, for shorter items it is called \textit{lexical} (or \textit{phrasal}) paraphrasing. For our project we investigated only lexical paraphrases, motivating this decision by the fact that other assistance tools within a CAT system may already provide multiple translation options for entire sentence, for example results of translation by using different bilingual parallel corpora. We also acknowledge that within scope of lexical paraphrases there is a further separation into two classes that correspond to shorter and longer phrases. Both cases were considered by us during evaluation stage.

We also took into account following study {[]}, which analyses usage patterns of another assistance tool, bilingual concordancer where authors suggest that average length of the input query is 2-3 words. Parallels between this assistance way and ours were discussed in previous chapter and in practice they motivate expectation of average paraphrasing query length to be similar.

\textbf{Realtime experience}. Another requirement for our interactive tool is providing paraphrasing options as fast as possible. Our tool will not be useful at all if it takes it to return results longer that time user spends on manual paraphrasing. Thus we considered time required to generate paraphrases in our evaluation. 

\textbf{Coexistence with manual editing}. While RePhraser aims to be used in order to fix erroneous part in the translation by getting the corrected paraphrase automatically, we acknowledge that final high quality translation cannot be achieved only by using paraphrasing. An ability to manually post-edit translation is crucial and designing our approach we considered that it will be used in an environment where translation could be altered by user at any time.
